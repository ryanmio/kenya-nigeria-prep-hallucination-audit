1. **AI-Powered Risk Prediction Models (Kenya and Nigeria)**  
   These models analyze data from electronic medical records (EMR), behavioral patterns, and community-level risk factors in real time. They are integrated into clinics to identify individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, enabling healthcare providers to offer PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) more strategically.

2. **Chatbots and Virtual Counselors for Stigma-Free Support (LMICs)**  
   AI-enabled chatbots and virtual counselors provide private, judgment-free spaces for users to learn about PrEP, manage side effects, and seek support. These tools are particularly beneficial for young people and marginalized populations, offering personalized and accessible HIV education.

3. **Video Consultations and App-Based Self-Screening (Nigeria, Kenya)**  
   Telemedicine platforms are being used to deliver PrEP with reduced reliance on in-person visits. Clients can initiate and manage their prevention care through video consultations, app-based self-screening, and pharmacy pick-up services, making HIV prevention more accessible in resource-constrained settings.

4. **AI for Medication Demand Forecasting (Kenya, Nigeria)**  
   AI tools predict medication demand, minimizing stockouts and ensuring a steady supply of PrEP at decentralized locations. This approach enhances supply chain management and ensures continuous availability of essential medications.

5. **AI-Enhanced Pharmacies and Community Access Points (Various LMICs)**  
   Pharmacies and community-based access points leverage AI tools to streamline client intake, flag high-risk individuals, and enable follow-ups. These tools integrate into national digital health systems to ensure consistent quality of care across diverse service delivery points.

These innovations demonstrate how AI and telemedicine are transforming HIV prevention by increasing accessibility, improving resource allocation, and personalizing care delivery in diverse settings."
