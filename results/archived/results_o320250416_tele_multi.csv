These tools are already streamlining virtual HIV-PrEP programs in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria, powering dermatology and radiology e-consults across U.S. and European health systems, and supporting chronic-disease monitoring in rural India and Brazil. By automating routine tasks and flagging high-risk cases early, AI makes remote care faster, more personalized, and scalable despite workforce or geographic constraints."
