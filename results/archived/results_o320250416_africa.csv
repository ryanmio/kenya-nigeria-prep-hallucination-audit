0,-,13.696892834495877,"1. AI-powered risk-prediction in clinics (Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda)  
   • Machine-learning models analyze electronic medical records, behavioral data and community-level risk factors in real time to flag individuals at highest risk of HIV acquisition and guide more strategic PrEP offers.  

2. Confidential PrEP chatbots and virtual counsellors for key populations  
   • AI chatbots provide stigma-free spaces to learn about PrEP, manage side-effects and obtain geo-located service referrals, improving retention and self-management among young people and other vulnerable groups.  

3. Tele-PrEP plus AI-driven supply forecasting  
   • Video consultations, app-based self-screening and pharmacy pick-up are paired with AI algorithms that forecast medication demand, cutting stock-outs in decentralized sites and keeping PrEP continuously available.  

4. “Digital coworker” tools for overstretched health workers  
   • In several African settings, AI systems handle triage, automate documentation and deliver on-the-job training or supervision to community health workers, extending service coverage in rural or under-resourced areas without replacing human staff.  

5. EMR-based retention and adherence prediction (e.g., Tanzania)  
   • Machine-learning models built on routine clinic data identify clients at risk of disengaging from HIV care or falling off PrEP, enabling targeted follow-up and more efficient allocation of limited prevention resources."
