1. **AI-powered Risk Prediction Models Integrated into Clinics**  
   - **Use:** Identify individuals most vulnerable to HIV acquisition by analyzing electronic medical records (EMR), behavioral patterns, and community-level risk factors in real-time.  
   - **Location:** Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including settings in Kenya and Uganda.  
   - **Benefit:** Enables providers to offer PrEP more strategically and tailor prevention efforts.

2. **Chatbots and Virtual Counselors for Stigma-free Education and Support**  
   - **Use:** Provide private, judgment-free spaces for users to learn about PrEP, manage side effects, ask questions, and support self-management including adherence reminders and virtual check-ins.  
   - **Location:** Various LMICs with a focus on young people and key populations.  
   - **Benefit:** Reduces burden on frontline workers and enhances client empowerment through telemedicine.

3. **Telemedicine Platforms for PrEP Access and Management**  
   - **Use:** Clients start and manage PrEP through video consultations, app-based self-screening, and pharmacy pick-up options, eliminating the need for frequent in-person visits. AI forecasts medication demand to reduce stockouts at decentralized locations.  
   - **Location:** Nigeria and Kenya.  
   - **Benefit:** Makes PrEP delivery more accessible, efficient, and sustainable in resource-constrained settings.

4. **AI as a “Digital Coworker” to Support Overstretched Staff**  
   - **Use:** AI tools handle triage, automate documentation, provide training and supervision to community health workers, and support routine tasks like initial risk assessments and appointment scheduling.  
   - **Location:** Several settings, particularly rural or under-resourced areas in LMICs.  
   - **Benefit:** Extends the reach and effectiveness of existing healthcare teams, especially amid health workforce shortages.

These examples illustrate how AI integrated with telemedicine is innovating HIV prevention delivery by improving risk stratification, enabling remote service access, supporting self-care, and augmenting healthcare workforce capacity in low-resource environments."
