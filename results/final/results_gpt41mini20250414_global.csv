   These models analyze electronic medical records (EMR), behavioral patterns, and community-level risk factors in real time to identify individuals most vulnerable to HIV acquisition. This helps healthcare providers offer PrEP more strategically. This approach is being implemented in clinics in LMICs, with specific examples including Kenya and Uganda.

2. **Chatbots and virtual counselors for stigma-free education and support:**  
   AI-enabled chatbots and virtual counselors provide private, judgment-free spaces for users—especially young people and key populations—to learn about PrEP, manage side effects, and ask questions. This telemedicine innovation supports HIV self-management remotely and helps reduce the burden on frontline workers. Chatbots have been studied and piloted in various settings, including in Kenya and Nigeria.

3. **Telemedicine for PrEP initiation and management via video consultations and app-based self-screening:**  
   In countries such as Nigeria and Kenya, telemedicine platforms allow clients to start and manage PrEP without frequent in-person visits. These platforms use AI to forecast medication demand, reducing stockouts and ensuring stable PrEP supply at decentralized locations like pharmacies. This integration of AI and telemedicine expands access in resource-constrained settings.

Additional notes:  
- AI is also used as a ""digital coworker"" to support overstretched health staff by automating triage, documentation, and training, especially in rural or under-resourced areas.  
- AI tools optimize demand generation through targeted outreach campaigns using chatbots, SMS, and social listening, enhancing engagement with younger and traditionally underserved populations.

These examples illustrate how AI-driven telemedicine innovations are already transforming HIV prevention services in LMICs, notably in African countries like Kenya and Nigeria."

   - **Description:** The digital health company MYDAWA, in partnership with Audere, implemented an AI system that assists clients in capturing high-quality photos of their HIV self-test results. The AI evaluates photo quality, prompts clients to retake low-quality images (up to three times), and enhances the image for better interpretation. It identifies and analyzes test and control lines to support clinical officers (COs) in remotely interpreting the test results. When AI and CO interpretations disagree, cases are flagged for supervisory review.  
   - **Benefits:** This AI integration enhances quality assurance in telehealth HIV testing, supports COs in accurate test interpretation, reduces the risk of false negatives, and facilitates supervisor oversight without requiring in-person testing. It also helps reduce the need for repeat tests due to poor image quality.  
   - **Where Used:** This AI system was deployed in Kenya during the ePrEP/ePEP pilot from 2022 to 2024, integrated into the telehealth and online pharmacy platform operated by MYDAWA.

2. **AI-Assisted Quality Control and Provider Performance Monitoring:**  
   - **Description:** The AI system flags discrepancies between its interpretation and the CO’s reading of HIVST results, enabling supervisors to focus on cases needing closer review and identify COs who may require additional training. This targeted approach to quality assurance supports continuous improvement of telehealth providers' performance.  
   - **Where Used:** As part of the ePrEP/ePEP service delivery model in Kenya’s online pharmacy pilot.

3. **Potential Use of AI in Expanding Diagnostic Support:**  
   - While not fully implemented in the pilot, the document mentions that AI can be trained to support a wide variety of HIV self-test products as they enter the market, thereby expanding telemedicine-supported HIV testing options. This AI adaptability can facilitate scale-up of telehealth services with diverse diagnostic products.  
   - **Where Applicable:** Future expansions of Kenya’s ePrEP/ePEP online pharmacy model or similar telemedicine platforms in comparable settings.

In summary, the innovative AI approaches in Kenya’s telemedicine-based HIV prevention model include AI-powered image quality assessment and interpretation of HIV self-tests to support remote diagnosis and prescription, quality assurance of telehealth providers through AI-flagged discrepancies, and the potential for AI to adapt to new diagnostic tools, all integrated within an online pharmacy and telehealth delivery system."
