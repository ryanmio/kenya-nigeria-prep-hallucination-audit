0,LOOSE,29.333333333333332,"AI-enabled telemedicine for HIV prevention pairs machine-learning risk-prediction models with virtual consults, chatbots, and app-based self-screening to triage clients, deliver stigma-free counseling, schedule visits, send adherence reminders, and forecast PrEP stock needs. Deployed in LMIC settings such as Nigeria and Kenya, these tools let people start or manage PrEP via video visits and pharmacy pick-ups, expanding access while easing staff workload and reducing clinic visits."
0,LOOSE,27.95031055900621,"AI is being woven into telemedicine platforms in LMICs such as Nigeria and Kenya, where video consultations, app-based self-screening and pharmacy pick-ups are paired with machine-learning risk models that flag who most needs PrEP and predictive algorithms that forecast drug demand to prevent stock-outs. Across these virtual services, chatbots and AI “digital coworkers” handle triage, counseling, adherence reminders and data analysis, giving patients stigma-free support while easing the load on overstretched health workers."
