• What it is: Conversational agents that give stigma-free PrEP education, side-effect management and geo-located service advice through phones or other tele-health channels.  
• Where it is being used: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), “especially critical for young people and key populations,” providing remote support without the need for clinic visits.

Example 2 – AI-enabled Tele-PrEP services in Nigeria and Kenya  
• What it is: A package that lets clients start and manage PrEP via video consultations, in-app self-screening, and pharmacy pick-up. AI algorithms also forecast local medication demand to prevent stock-outs.  
• Where it is being used: Nigeria and Kenya, where these tele-medicine workflows are already allowing people to obtain and follow-up on PrEP with minimal in-person contact.

Example 3 – “AI as a digital coworker” for remote triage & documentation  
• What it is: AI tools that perform first-line triage, automate routine documentation and provide virtual training/supervision for community health workers—freeing scarce staff to focus on complex care.  
• Where it is being used: “Several settings” in rural or under-resourced areas across LMICs, where overstretched teams use the system as part of tele-health services to extend reach and maintain service coverage."
