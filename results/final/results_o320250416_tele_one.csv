• What it does: Lets clients initiate and manage PrEP entirely online via video consultations and app-based self-screening; medications are collected at local pharmacies or delivered.  
• AI component: Embedded algorithms analyse real-time dispensing data to forecast PrEP demand, preventing stock-outs and keeping decentralised supply points stocked.  
• Why it’s innovative: Couples telemedicine with AI-driven supply-chain intelligence, expanding stigma-free access while safeguarding continuity of PrEP in resource-constrained settings."
