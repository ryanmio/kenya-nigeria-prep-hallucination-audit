This AI system supports clinical officers (COs) in remotely verifying clients' HIV self-test (HIVST) results by:

- Assessing and improving photo quality of the HIVST results by prompting clients to upload clearer photos if necessary.
- Automatically identifying and analyzing test and control lines on the HIVST to assist COs in interpreting results.
- Enhancing quality control by allowing supervisors to review cases where AI and CO interpretations differ.
- Being intentionally tuned to be highly sensitive to faint test lines to minimize false negatives, with COs retaining final decision authority.
- Enabling easier and more accurate interpretation of HIVSTs remotely, facilitating telehealth-based prescription of PrEP and PEP.

This integration of AI into the telehealth and online pharmacy model enhances quality assurance and helps ensure accurate HIV testing, which is critical for safely initiating PrEP or PEP remotely. The AI system was an added feature, not required by local authorities, and represents an innovative application of AI to support decentralized HIV prevention service delivery in Kenya.

This AI system supports clinical officers (COs) in remotely verifying clients’ HIVST results by:

- Assessing and improving the quality of photos uploaded by clients of their HIV test results, prompting clients to retake photos if image quality is poor.

- Automatically identifying and analyzing test and control lines on HIV test kits to assist COs in interpreting test results.

- Providing quality control by flagging discrepancies between AI and CO interpretations for supervisor review.

This AI integration enhances quality assurance and quality control in the telehealth and online pharmacy delivery model (ePrEP/ePEP) by making HIVST results easier to interpret remotely, reducing the risk of misinterpretation, and supporting supervisory oversight.

This AI system supports clinical officers (COs) in remotely verifying clients’ HIV test results by:

- Assessing the quality of photos uploaded by clients of their HIVST results, prompting clients to retake poor-quality images up to three times.

- Cropping and enhancing images of the test result window to aid interpretation.

- Identifying and analyzing test and control lines to provide a second opinion on test results, which the CO reviews before confirming.

- Flagging discrepancies between AI and CO interpretations for supervisory review to ensure quality assurance (QA).

The AI is intentionally tuned to be highly sensitive to faint lines to reduce missed positive cases, with fine-tuning performed during the pilot to improve specificity. This approach enhances quality control of HIVST interpretation within a telehealth and online pharmacy model delivering PrEP and PEP services, enabling private, convenient, and rapid access to HIV prevention in urban Kenya.
