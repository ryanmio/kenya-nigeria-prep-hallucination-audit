As the global HIV response enters its fifth decade, the stakes for its future have never been higher. With health-care budgets tightening, donor priorities shifting, and workforce constraints placing strain on overburdened systems, innovation is no longer optional—it is a lifeline.

Progress on global HIV prevention remains dangerously off course with new infections continuing to outpace progress, even with the acceleration of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scale-up since 2022.1 The global HIV response is also facing serious setbacks. HIV prevention programming funded by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has been halted as part of the US Government's cuts to foreign aid;2 this, combined with reductions from other donors, threatens to decimate hard-won progress at the very moment when acceleration is needed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a unique opportunity to reimagine delivery systems and increase public health impact, if deployed ethically and at equitable scale. Drawing on insights from a March, 2025, consultation convened by Audere Africa and the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation, the resulting insights in this Comment point to a crucial opportunity where AI can help rewire how HIV services are delivered, making them more effective and more efficient.3

In such a precarious resource landscape, AI offers clear and expanding value, particularly when embedded in well designed health systems that prioritise equity. When resourced appropriately, these tools can create a people-centred model for HIV prevention—one that enhances patient engagement, improves effective use, and ensures sustainable, accessible care for everyone.

AI extends the reach of overstretched health-care workers by automating routine functions such as triage, scheduling appointments, follow-up reminders, and adherence checks.4 In Kenya and Nigeria, AI powers telemedicine-based PrEP services that eliminate the need for frequent clinic visits.5,6 Clients can conduct self-testing, consult with a provider virtually, and pick up medication from conveniently located community pharmacies. Predictive models could further enhance these programmes by helping providers identify individuals at greatest risk of HIV acquisition, forecast supply needs, and target outreach efforts more effectively.7

Furthermore, tools such as AI chatbots, SMS reminders, and virtual self-risk assessments help individuals manage their health in real time, with greater privacy, convenience, and autonomy.8 This self-management is especially important for young people and key populations who often face stigma in traditional care, which often deters them from accessing traditional services; AI platforms offer a safe, judgment-free way to ask questions, report side-effects, and effectively use products such as PrEP.9

At the systems level, AI could enable efficient resource planning and better decision making. Programme managers can analyse large-scale datasets to forecast medication stock, generate culturally tailored advice, identify geographical hotspots, improve outreach approaches, and refine training and resource allocation.

Still, challenges remain. Universal access to technology cannot be assumed. Cost of data, limited internet access, and low digital literacy continue to exclude many, especially in rural or underserved settings. Ensuring equitable access to AI-driven services requires investments in infrastructure, affordability, and training. Additionally, AI is only as good as the data going into the system: standards for data quality and use are therefore of utmost importance.

Donors and governments will need to invest in clearer guidance, better evaluation frameworks, and stronger mechanisms for community engagement and oversight. Over time, greater competition among technology providers and stronger price control could also accelerate scale by driving down costs and promoting more open, adaptable platforms.

Ethical considerations are paramount. Particularly in environments in which key populations are criminalised or stigmatised, AI tools must comply with stringent privacy protocols and fully transparent data policies. Developers and implementers must go beyond consultation to embrace co-design, inviting affected communities and civil society organisations to lead on tool development, implementation, and evaluation.10

Although major actors, such as WHO and donors, are starting to see the potential of AI in HIV care and prevention, funding for large-scale use is still limited due to competing budget priorities. Investments must move beyond pilot projects to scalable platforms aligned with national strategies. AI should complement—not replace—donor and national funding by enhancing the impact, efficiency, and reach of existing health investments.

The HIV field has long led the charge on health innovation. From task-shifting and differentiated service delivery to community-led outreach and peer navigation, HIV programmes have repeatedly shown how to serve populations at scale, with quality and effectiveness. With dedicated funding and safeguards, AI can become the next frontier of that legacy.
