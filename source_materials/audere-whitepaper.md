While PrEP scale-up was 
continuing to accelerate in 
2024, overall prevention efforts 
remain far off track, with new 
HIV infections continuing to 
outpace PrEP uptake.1 
PEPFAR’s current funding freeze 
on HIV prevention, as part of the 
Trump administration’s 90-day 
foreign aid review, exacerbates 
this crisis, halting momentum on 
PrEP scale up precisely when 
acceleration is most needed.2
Amid this turbulence, 
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is 
no longer just on the 
horizon—it’s here, reshaping 
global health programming with 
new urgency and potential.
With health systems under 
strain and human resources 
stretched thin, AI presents a 
transformative opportunity to overcome programmatic 
barriers and fast-track progress 
toward achieving global targets 
by 2030.
However, this potential can only 
be fully realized if AI solutions 
are designed with community 
input, prioritize digital equity, and 
uphold quality and ethical 
standards, ensuring that 
innovations serve those who 
need them most.
In 2024, PEPFAR 
acknowledged this potential by 
including AI in its draft country 
operational guidance, and early 
in 2025, WHO announced a 
collaborating center on AI - a 
signal that global health leaders 
are beginning to take this shift 
seriously. 3 4The global HIV response stands at a precarious 
crossroads. With U.S. government funding freezes, 
shifting donor priorities, and geopolitical 
uncertainty, hard-won gains in prevention and 
treatment are under threat. signal that global health 
leaders are beginning to take this shift seriously.Why AI and
why now?

In HIV care, traditional risk assessment tools have failed to keep pace with the dynamic nature of 
the epidemic. AI and machine learning can help rethink risk stratiﬁcation, drawing from richer, com-
munity-informed data to better tailor services.5 At the same time, promising but underutilized plat-
forms—such as pharmacies and mobile delivery—remain untapped opportunities for expanding 
access, especially when paired with AI-driven tools.
Still, the HIV ﬁeld is well positioned to lead the integration of AI into health systems with decades of 
experience in innovation, community-centered design, and task-shifting. What’s more, the HIV 
response operates at a scale unmatched in global health—thanks to robust public-private partner-
ships, community-led networks, and established platforms supported by major funders like 
PEPFAR, the Global Fund, the Gates Foundation and others. These assets offer a unique testbed 
for responsibly deploying AI technologies in ways that can inform broader health systems, from TB 
and STIs to primary care and health surveillance.
This landmark report—shaped by a consultation hosted by Audere and the Desmond 
Tutu Health Foundation in March, 2025—explores how to move from crisis to opportunity. 
It lays out how smart, ethical, and inclusive AI deployment can help reinvigorate the HIV response, 
ensure no one is left behind, and build a more resilient health future.

Participants in the consultation highlighted the 
catalytic role AI can play in strengthening and 
scaling HIV prevention programs, especially amid 
health workforce shortages, limited funding, and the 
need for more targeted services. AI and digital tools 
can optimize HIV prevention by enhancing demand 
creation, predicting adherence risks, and 
supporting differentiated service delivery models. 
By analyzing behavioral patterns, identifying 
adherence challenges, and tailoring interventions to 
individual needs, AI can enable programs to align 
more closely with user preferences. This 
personalized approach can improve retention, 
enhance outcomes, and make PrEP services more 
accessible, efﬁcient, and responsive. Ultimately, 
integrating AI into HIV prevention has the potential to 
improve service delivery, expand reach, and 
accelerate progress toward epidemic control.
AI tools can also help provide information and 
remote access to services to people who face 
stigma, enable more precise HIV vulnerability risk 
stratiﬁcation, identify individuals at risk of 
disengagement from care, and optimize the timing 
and targeting of prevention services. Evidence from 
electronic medical record (EMR)-based machine 
learning models shows effectiveness in clinical 
decision support across the HIV continuum—from 
PrEP initiation to retention and viral 
suppression—while also reducing costs and 
improving resource allocation.6
Additionally, AI can automate data collection and 
analysis, enabling governments and partners to 
identify gaps, adapt programs in real time, and 
improve overall efﬁciency. When collective, scalable 
solutions are developed and integrated responsibly 
into donor-supported HIV platforms, AI can support 
more responsive, differentiated, and equitable 
service delivery.
A key area of agreement was enhanced HIV 
program management. AI can support health workers by handling routine tasks such as initial risk 
assessments, adherence reminders, and 
appointment scheduling. This allows staff to focus 
on more complex aspects of care while maintaining 
service coverage, especially in areas facing 
workforce shortages.
AI also supports HIV self-management. Through 
chatbots, virtual check-ins, and personalized digital 
reminders, AI-enabled tools can help individuals 
manage PrEP adherence, navigate side effects, or 
ﬁnd nearby services through geo-location. 7 This 
not only empowers clients but also reduces the 
burden on frontline workers, making service delivery 
more sustainable.8
Participants also highlighted AI’s potential to drive 
personalized prevention efforts. AI also shows 
promise in improving risk stratiﬁcation—a 
long-standing challenge in HIV prevention.9 
Traditional screening tools often fall short in 
identifying those who would most beneﬁt from PrEP . 
AI-based models could help address this gap by 
using more diverse, real-time data, combined with 
the conﬁdentiality afforded by AI chatbots, to 
improve targeting.
On a systems level, AI can contribute to 
data-informed decision-making through rapid 
analysis of large-scale datasets, including better 
forecasting of supply needs, optimizing outreach, 
and identifying geographic hotspots for intervention. 
10 These insights can help programs do more with 
fewer resources, especially as ﬁnancial uncertainty 
grows. Finally, AI was recognized as a potential 
resilience mechanism-- with the right enabling 
environment, AI can help provide continuity and 
efﬁciency during periods of disruption, such as 
funding disruptions and staff shortages. The value proposition

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), AI and telemedicine are 
transforming how HIV prevention—particularly PrEP—is delivered to those 
who need it most. AI-powered risk prediction models are now being 
integrated into clinics to identify individuals most vulnerable to HIV 
acquisition, helping providers offer PrEP more strategically. These models 
analyze data from EMR, behavioral patterns, and community-level risk 
factors, often in real time. Meanwhile, chatbots and virtual counselors are 
enabling stigma-free education and support, offering users private, 
judgment-free spaces to learn about PrEP , manage side effects, and ask 
questions—especially critical for young people and key populations.12
Telemedicine has also opened new doors for PrEP access by eliminating 
the need for frequent in-person visits. In countries like Nigeria and Kenya, 
clients can start and manage PrEP through video consultations, app-based 
self-screening, and pharmacy pick-up options. AI is further used to forecast 
medication demand, reducing stockouts and ensuring a stable supply of 
PrEP at decentralized locations. Together, these tools are making PrEP 
delivery smarter, more inclusive, and more sustainable—even in 
resource-constrained settings.
Pharmacies and other community access points are another area of 
opportunity. While these platforms already play a role in HIV testing and 
PrEP distribution in some countries, they remain largely limited in scope. 
There are various reasons for the limited expansion of these options, 
including restrictive policies, and sometimes, inadequate stafﬁng. 
AI-enabled tools could enhance these access points—streamlining client 
intake, ﬂagging high-risk individuals, and enabling follow-up without needing 
to rely on traditional clinical infrastructure. When coupled with interoperability 
facilitated through a national digital health architecture, AI also enables the 
ability to monitor care delivery across diverse access points to ensure 
consistent linkage to quality care.
Lastly, AI is already being explored as a tool for demand generation. By 
analyzing trends, preferences, and behaviors, AI can inform more relevant, 
targeted outreach—especially for younger populations or groups with limited 
engagement in traditional healthcare systems. Chatbots, SMS campaigns, 
and social listening tools powered by AI are being piloted to improve 
awareness and uptake of PrEP and HIV testing services.13While AI in HIV programming may still feel new to some, 
participants highlighted a growing number of innovations already in 
use or being tested—many of which are helping close gaps in 
access, workforce capacity, and client engagement. One approach 
gaining traction is AI as a “digital coworker.” In several settings, 
AI tools are already supporting overstretched staff by handling 
triage, automating documentation, and even providing training and 
supervision to community health workers. These applications are 
not about replacing people—they’re about extending the reach and 
effectiveness of existing teams, especially in rural or 
under-resourced areas.11One approach

While AI offers promise in global health, it carries 
risks that demand attention. Weak data privacy 
protections - especially in low-resource settings - 
expose sensitive health information. Algorithms 
trained on biased or non-representative datasets 
risk deepening existing health disparities.
Opaque “black box” models can undermine trust 
and make accountability difﬁcult. The absence of 
clear regulatory frameworks increases the 
chances of misuse or unintended harm. 14 15
Many AI tools also ignore real-world constraints 
like poor internet connectivity, electricity outages, 
and workforce shortages, limiting their 
effectiveness and long-term sustainability. 
Meanwhile, excessive hype can lead to 
overpromising, pilot fatigue, and a shift in focus - 
and funding - away from proven interventions. 16
To mitigate these challenges, the global health 
community must prioritize equity, transparency, 
and human-centered design. Governance 
mechanisms, inclusive datasets, and 
context-appropriate implementation are essential 
to ensure AI enhances rather than hinders public 
health outcomes.
Above all, success depends on bridging the 
digital divide, where high data costs, connectivity 
gaps, and limited access to devices continue to 
leave many behind.Risk & mitigation strategies

Participants emphasized that it is time for HIV programs to adopt an AI mindset, expressing strong interest in 
leveraging AI to strengthen prevention efforts and improve outcomes. However, many implementers highlighted the 
steep learning curve and lack of clear guidance in evaluating AI tools.
The current landscape is complex and fragmented, making it difﬁcult for program leads to identify technologies that 
are safe, effective, and appropriate for their settings. Building trust in AI solutions requires more than 
demonstrations—it demands rigorous validation, real time monitoring, real-world testing, and structured community 
feedback.
Governments and donors—including PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and others—are increasingly open to AI’s potential.17 
Yet dedicated funding for AI development, integration, monitoring, and continued innovation in HIV programs across 
LMICs, particularly in Africa, remains limited. Participants underscored the need to move from broad interest to 
targeted, intentional, sustained investments in AI research, implementation, and capacity-building tailored to local 
challenges.
To unlock this potential, focused investment in governance, implementation support, the overall digital health enabling 
environment, and community-led innovation is essential. The following recommendations are designed to guide 
stakeholders in advancing AI in HIV prevention programs across LMICs.
For HIV Program Managers and Tool Developers
Place Communities at the Center of AI Design for HIV:
To ensure AI tools for HIV prevention are effective, trusted, and contextually relevant, developers should 
meaningfully engage key populations and frontline implementers throughout the entire design and development 
lifecycle. While co-design is increasingly acknowledged in theory, the systematic inclusion of communities in the 
vetting and validation of AI tools remains insufﬁcient in many formal processes. Prioritizing community input 
alongside technical validation is essential to addressing real-world barriers, fostering trust, and aligning with the 
growing emphasis on community-anchored program sustainability championed by major donors. This inclusive 
approach not only enhances the relevance and equity of AI-powered solutions but also extends the longevity 
and impact of associated investments.
Advance Digital and AI Literacy for Inclusive Participation:
Programs should prioritize AI literacy across key populations, health workers, civil society organizations (CSOs), 
and government stakeholders. Building the capacity of these groups to actively participate in the design, 
development, monitoring, and regulation of AI tools—and, critically, to select, use, and govern them—will be 
essential for sustainable, country-led integration of AI into health systems.Recommendations for
scaling AI in the HIV response

03.Strengthen Data Privacy and Consent Protocols:
AI-driven tools must adhere to robust consent protocols and stringent data protection standards—particularly 
when engaging with criminalized or marginalized populations.18 Equally important is ensuring that individuals are 
clearly informed about how their data are collected, used, stored, and who has access to their personal 
information. Transparent communication and accountability are foundational. Adapting global data governance 
frameworks to local contexts is critical for fostering long-term trust and safeguarding rights.

Empower Frontline Workers with AI Support:
AI should not only augment human decision-making, but also explicitly enhance the efﬁciency of frontline 
health workers and improve care delivery outcomes. AI tools for health should follow an iterative approach 
rooted in rapid evaluation and real-time course correction. Crucially, AI is meant to support—not 
replace—human judgment. For instance, automated risk assessments should be complemented by peer 
or provider veriﬁcation to ensure that interventions remain contextually appropriate, responsive, and 
grounded in human understanding.
Integrate AI Seamlessly into Health Systems:
AI solutions should align with national digital health architectures, be built on open standards, and remain 
adaptable across diverse country contexts. Transparent monitoring and reporting on AI performance and 
effectiveness—paired with targeted investment in high-impact tools and strengthened collaboration 
among AI developers—are essential to avoid fragmentation and ensure long-term sustainability.
Establish Systems for Sustained Data Integrity and Fact-Based Decision Making:
AI systems are only as trustworthy as the data they are built on. In an era of rising misinformation and 
politicized attacks on science, it is essential to protect the accuracy and reliability of data informing and being 
used to validate AI models. This includes investing in high-quality, community-informed datasets for both 
training and assessing AI, building auditability into algorithms, alignment on transparent reporting standards, 
and supporting public health institutions in defending evidence-based practices. Ongoing data quality 
assurance, including mechanisms to identify and correct bias, is critical to maintaining public trust. Programs 
must also proactively counter disinformation and support digital literacy as part of AI roll-out strategies.04.
Developing Guidance for Safe AI Deployment:
Global health stakeholders should focus on developing context-speciﬁc guidance for the safe and 
effective use of AI in HIV and broader health programs. Establishing standards for ethics, procurement, 
community vetting, technical evaluation, and ongoing monitoring will enable responsible deployment and 
help ensure that all AI tools made available to communities are safe, trusted, and effective.19 This 
approach will reduce costs, accelerate the scale-up of proven solutions, and speed up 
results—amplifying the impact and efﬁciency of donor investments.01.
Coordinated Funding to Scale AI Solutions:
PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and other donors should coordinate funding to scale and replicate promising AI 
solutions, in line with country needs and strategies. This includes creating incentives for AI developers to 
collaborate on complementary, high-impact tools that demonstrate improved targeting, better health 
outcomes, or cost efﬁciencies. Examples include digital vulnerability screening for PrEP , tailored chatbots 
for self-care and adherence support, predictive models to prevent program dropout, and tools which 
monitor safe and effective AI use at scale.02.05.
06.
For Governments, Donors, and Global Partners
Empowering CSOs to Lead AI Implementation:
Donors should provide sustained funding to local CSOs —not only to design, test, and evaluate AI 
interventions, but also to implement and scale them effectively. Rather than treating AI as a secondary 
component, programs should consider digital- or AI-ﬁrst approaches that can accelerate progress toward 
health goals and serve as resilience mechanisms during times of resource constraint. By placing these 
organizations at the center of AI efforts, donors can ensure solutions are rooted in real-world challenges, 
community priorities, and human rights principles.03.

Update National Digital Health Strategies to Include AI for Ethical HIV Innovation:
Governments should include AI in their national digital health strategies that prioritize the ethical and 
equitable use of technology in HIV programs, aligning with national HIV goals and identifying priority 
areas where AI can enhance prevention, treatment, and care outcomes. Establishing clear regulatory 
frameworks that address data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and community consent will provide 
a secure foundation for AI deployment. To maximize impact, governments should facilitate 
multi-sector partnerships that bring together tech developers, global health stakeholders, and civil 
society to co-design AI solutions that are context-speciﬁc and responsive to community needs.05.
Invest in the Digital Health Enabling Environment:
AI tools rely on many of the same foundational building blocks that effective digital health interventions 
do, including strong leadership and governance, strategy and investment, standards and 
interoperability, and workforce capacity.20 Investing in local capacity through workforce training and 
improved digital infrastructure is essential to sustain these efforts, while promoting data interoperability 
will ensure seamless integration of AI tools into existing health systems.06.
Harmonize Global Guidance for AI in Health:
Donors, governments, and multilateral agencies such as WHO, UNAIDS, and UNICEF should work 
toward the development of aligned, practical standards and normative guidance for the ethical and 
effective use of AI in health programs. This includes establishing shared deﬁnitions, benchmarks for 
performance and safety, transparent reporting standards for AI models, and minimum ethical 
standards for community participation and non-discrimination. Ensuring global 
consistency—particularly across regulatory, procurement, and implementation frameworks—will 
reduce fragmentation and accelerate responsible uptake of AI across country contexts. Clear 
alignment across normative bodies also strengthens country capacity to assess and govern AI use in 
line with national goals and human rights commitments.07.
