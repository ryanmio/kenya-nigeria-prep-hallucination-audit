This guide reflects the efforts of partners who collaborated to enable effective pre- and post -exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP) delivery through a telehealth and online pharmacy model  (ePrEP/ePEP)  in 
Kenya from 2022 to 2024. Key partners included:  
• MYDAWA , a Kenya -based digital health  company  with an integrated platform for telehealth 
and e -pharmacy  service delivery that provided ePrEP/ ePEP in Nairobi and Mombasa during 
the pilot.  
• Jhpiego , a nonprofit global health organization  that provided technical assistance to ensure 
ePrEP/ ePEP services met national requirements , supported stakeholder engagement to seek 
policy exemptions for the implementation research , and  with the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Public Health , starting in January 2024 led research on the sustainability phase of 
this pilot .  
• Audere , a nonprofit  company  working in digital health  that built an artificial intelligence –
facilitated digital photo capture and result interpretation system for HIV self -tests and rapid  
diagnostic  tests.  
• Research partners —the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Kenya 
Medical Research Institute, and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and 
Technology —who evaluated the model and developed academic publications to inform 
policy.  
• HS Design , a user experience partner  that conducted usability analyses of the digital health 
company ’s client and provider interface.  
Several individuals made  substantial contributions, including  the following : Dr. Samira Abdulrashid

Scope and purpose of this guide 
This document is intended as a ho w-to implementation guide for providing oral pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-expo sure prophylaxis (PEP) via onli ne pharmacy service delivery 
(ePrEP/ePEP) based on l earnings and evidence  from the ePrEP Ken ya pilot study that ran from October 
2022 through July 2024, when this guide was published.  
The guide outlines a s uggested approach tha t can be tailored ba sed on epidemiological, social, 
economic, health systems, and po licy contexts. Service delivery  partners should exercise flexibility and 
adapt these guidelines and tools to their specific operating co ntexts and circums tances, available 
resources, and infrastructure. 
This document is intended to suppo rt ministries of health and t heir partners as they develop 
strategies for HIV prevention se rvices—specifically, ePrEP and ePEP delivery (i.e., through a telehealth 
and online pharmacy model). 
About the model 
Through this model, clients acce ssed PrEP or PEP services throu gh telehealth consul tation and product 
delivery via a digital health com pany’s online pharmacy in urba n Kenya. Clients completed HIV risk 
assessment and counseling, got t ested via a rapid diagnostic te st (RDT) or blood-based HIV self-test 
(HIVST), and virtually received a PrEP or PEP prescription from  a clinical officer (CO) employed by the 
Kenyan digital health company. T he company delivered the HIVST or rapid diagnostic test kits, PEP, 
and PrEP to clients primarily thr ough riders who are pharmaceut ical technologists (“pharm techs”) and 
trained on HIV testing. The comp any also offered counseling to support clients’ PEP-to-PrEP transition 
and refills for PrEP continuation. Figure 1 shows the steps of the model from the pers pective of clients.

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya        Page  iv  Takeaways  
Online pharmacy  service delivery of PrEP and PEP w as 
feasible  as an option  in urban Kenya and  acceptable  to 
clients with behaviors associated with HIV risk  
• The model reached 1,7 57 clients with PrEP /PEP over 
approximately 14 months (October  19, 2022, through 
December 31, 2023 ).2 An average of more than 100 
clients per month accessed PrEP or PEP through the 
digital health company ’s online pharmacy platform 
during this pilot.  
• This model reached a population that differs from 
those accessing PrEP/PEP at public clinic –based 
facilities : a larger number of men, unmarried  individuals , and those with sexual partners with 
unknown HIV status , as well as men who have sex with men ( MSM ), who accounted for a 
sizable proportion of PrEP clients (22% or 45/208)  but only 2 % of PEP clients  (26/1,549 ).2 The 
proportion of PrEP clients who were MSM  is notable given that th e MSM  population is much 
smaller than the general population.  While marketing targeted many demographic groups  
with vulnerability to  HIV, far more men than women used the service. Very few clients 
reported transactional sex or a partner with HIV.  The majority of clients had no prior use of 
PrEP or PEP.  
• Most clients screened for PrEP and PEP were eligible and received the service.  This means they 
reported behaviors associated with vulnerability to HIV or recent exposure and had no 
medical conditions that could contraindicate PrEP/PEP safety.  
• Privacy was a top consideration for clients using this model. Many clients did not turn on their 
video during their telehealth consultation and requested delivery at a location other than their 
home  for privacy reasons.  
• Convenience was another important reason clients gave for choosing this model , with the 
digital health company offering to deliver orders  to a location of the client’s choosing within  
four hours  of submitting their order . 
The online pharmacy model in Kenya had higher PEP uptake compared to PrEP  
• Despite the initial focus of all online advertising and demand creation on PrEP  (not PEP ), PEP 
uptake was more than 7 times higher than PrEP uptake through the online pharmacy model. 
Over approximately 14 months, 1 ,549 clients received PEP , and 208 received PrEP .2  
• Clients commonly confused PrEP and PEP when initially seeking services. Nearly all clients 
requested PrEP during the initial consultation, having  been exposed to HIV within  the 
preceding  72 hours , and had to be educated on the need to use PEP before considering a 
transition to PrEP. The median time between exposure and PEP delivery was 39 hours.2 
• Only 6 % of PEP clients  transitioned to PrEP:2  
o After their 28 -day PEP regimen, most clients said they did not intend to have another HIV 
exposure and did not need  PrEP. Clients also reported the cost of taking another HIV test 
as a barrier to PrEP transition.  
o Nearly all clients who had successfully transition ed from PEP to PrEP were linked to one 
CO who provided  empathy -based counseling and took time to encourage transition. 
Thus,  the digital health company  prioritized  empathy counseling skills in CO qualifications “I think [this model] is the most 
convenient because it is 
delivered to my doorstep, and it 
is delivered discreetly  to my 
doorstep. I don’t have to go to 
the pharmacy and wait in line or 
order the PrEP in front of 
people.”

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya        Page  v  and training . The PEP -to-PrEP transition rate steadily increased from 2 % (3/147 clients) 
during  quarter  4 (Q4) 2022 to 12% (49 /405 clients) during  Q4 2023 .  
o Of PEP clients , 7% obtained PEP more than once during the pilot, and 14 % had used PEP 
prior to this pilot.  
o More than half of PrEP clients ( 58%) did not return for a refill after the first month, similar 
to discontinuation  rates observed in  other pharmacy models  in Kenya.2 Qualitative 
feedba ck indicated that clients discontinued PrEP due  to side effects, pill burden, and/or a 
change in their perceived likelihood of future exposure to HIV.  
Financial sustainability depends on access to low -cost commodities  
• Clients were willing to pay for services  at the prices offered through this model, which 
factored in  PrEP and PEP commodity donations from the  Kenyan government .  
• The business sustainability model  (see “Business model overview” section  and the Appendix 7 
template for business sustainability analytics ) indicates that ePrEP/ ePEP will break even or 
make a small  profit. Pull -through revenue from general health consultations and prescription 
and product sales may support consistent revenue growth to make ePrEP/ ePEP viable as a 
continued offering.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 1  Introduction  
Biomedical HIV prevention methods offer the potential to reduce new HIV infections and improve 
health outcomes among people vulnerable to HIV. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO)  
released  its recommendation of  daily oral pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention  as part 
of combination prevention approaches for people at substantial risk of HIV .3 Since then, countries with 
high HIV prevalence have worked to scale up access to oral PrEP alongside post -exposure prophylaxis 
(PEP) .   
However, while oral PrEP adoption among key populations has been high in a number of settings, use 
generally remains low among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and men , despite its proven 
effectiveness , partially  due to concerns about stigma , privacy , and potential  side effects  that deter 
effective use and continuation .4,5 In addition,  PrEP services are largely limited to  public -sector  
(government ) health care facilities , which also can deter  use, especially among populations who prefer 
services in alternative settings , such as  community and private -sector outlets (e.g., pharmacies , 
recreation spaces).6 Even less is known about effective approaches for reaching clients with rapid PEP 
following possible HIV exposure.  Clinical trials ha ve established that several newer PEP regi mens are 
better tolerated , yet use is low globally. Innovations are needed to reach more clients with PEP with in 
72 hours of possible HIV exposure , in addition to policy changes that facilitate uptake and completion 
of PEP .7  
The COVID -19 pandemic accelerated the introduction and expansion of decentralized  health service 
delivery models, including PrEP, outside of facility settings to enhance service accessibility . In 2022 , 
WHO updated its PrEP implementation guidance to promote differentiated and simplified PrEP as a 
person - and community -centered approach that could increase PrEP acceptability , accessibility , 
uptake, persistence, and effective use.10 In its 2022 HIV Prevention 2025 – Road Map , the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS echoed this need for community -led, integrated, and differentiated 
approaches to combination prevention services, highlighting community, school, and private -sector 
models and virtual platforms as modalities for increasing access.11 
Private and community 
pharmacies and online 
pharmacy /telehealth 
platforms  hold promise as 
discreet  and convenient 
pathways for biomedical HIV 
prevention services .12,13 The 
WHO  2022 PrEP guidance 
emphasizes the potential of 
online pharmacy and 
telehealth model s to enhance 
PrEP access, uptake, and 
effective use , noting that 
pharmacies a re more 
accessible, acceptable, and 
convenient as access point s 
than health facilities, 
especially in resource -limited 
settings . This guidance , as well 
as a separate review of mobile Expanding range of biomedical HIV prevention options   
Research and development are advancing a diverse suite of new 
PrEP/PEP products as biomedical prevention options to promote 
uptake by enhancing client choice. Injectable cabotegravir for PrEP 
(injectable PrEP) and the dapivirine vaginal ring, recommended a s 
additional prevention choices by WHO in 2021 and 2022, 
respectively, have begun to enter markets. With preliminary results 
indicating the safety and efficacy of twice -yearly injectable 
lenacapavir for PrEP among cisgender women,8 six-month 
subcutaneous injectables and monthly oral pills could be 
introduced over the next few years, once approved as safe and 
effective. While this guide focuses on the role that telehealth and 
online pharmacies can play in expanding oral PrEP and PEP access, 
many of the recommendations may be applicable to other HIV 
prevention methods as they enter the market in the future, with 
modifications and considerations made to prescription and 
delivery processes for injectable and long -acting PrEP 
formulations .9 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 2  and web -based PrEP  platforms , point s to the early success of telehealth platforms in supporting high 
PrEP persistence by and acceptab ility to clients  and in offering more convenient PrEP services while 
reducing stigma , transportation requirements,  and wait times .10  
While use of an online pharmacy platform indicates strong potential for increasing PrEP/ PEP uptake 
and use, additional evidence is needed to demonstrate  the feasibility  and effectiveness  of this model 
in supporting  PrEP initiation, continuation , and PEP -to-PrEP transition over time and across 
geographic and demographic contexts. Private -sector  PrEP/PEP delivery  channels are currently not the 
standard of care in most countries , and implementation would require changes to policy and practice.  
With the growing call for expansion of differentiated and decentralized HIV prevention services, 
including in the latest Global Fund 2023 –2025 Funding Cycle,14 further evidence and lessons from the 
telehealth and pharmacy PrEP model are needed to inform policies and implementation . Drawing 
from evidence and lessons learned from a demonstration of an ePrEP/ ePEP delivery model, this 
document aims to provide policymakers, technical support partners , and implementers  / online 
pharmacies  with guidance for implementation of similar models according to their individual contexts.

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 3  Program model  
Overview  
In Kenya, a group of partners with expertise in advocacy, policy, research, program  implementation , 
technology, and commerce collaborated to design and implement an effective PrEP and PEP delivery 
model  through online pharmacies  (ePrEP/ePEP)  from 2022  to 2024. The country -specific HIV 
prevention context for this pilot is provided in Appendix 1.  
Phase 1 of the pilot took place from October 2022 through December 2023. Phase 1 was immediately 
followed by phase 2 , which ran  from January to November 2024 and involved  studying the 
sustainability of the model after the end of donor support to the digital health company  used in the 
pilot (MYDAWA) .   
Under this partnership,  the digital health company  received technical and financial assistance  to:  
• Design  or leverage an existing  online pharmacy system and procedures to enable distribution 
of PrEP and PEP.  
• Design and conduct demand  generation activities .  
• Provide  online -to-offline services for clients seeking PrEP or PEP , including  offering  
telehealth/virtual services  to counsel clients, conduct ing eligibility and medical safety 
screening, and conditionally prescrib ing PrEP/PEP pending HIV test results and in -
person/home -based HIV testing services . Testing was conducted using either rapid diagnostic 
tests (RDTs) or HIV self -tests (HIVST s), with artificial intelligence ( AI)–assisted quality control 
for results  interpretation  and PrEP/PEP dispensing .  
• Enable clients to order  RDTs, HIVSTs, PrEP, and PEP online . 
• Deliver the HIVSTs, RDTs, PEP, and PrEP to clients , primarily  via riders who are also 
pharmaceutical technologists (“ pharm techs ”) trained by the Division of National AIDS and STI 
Control Program (NASCOP ) on HIV testing.  In limited cases , through the two -step delivery 
model  (see “Client Journeys” below) , lay riders without medical training delivered HIVSTs .  
There are several factors to consider when establishing ePrEP/ ePEP service delivery through an online 
pharmacy. Appendix 2 provides a checklist of key topics and questions that stakeholders should 
consider when planning to introduce  an ePrEP/ ePEP model. Responses to these questions can inform 
the development of a customized ePrEP/ ePEP introduction roadmap that partners can use during the 
setup  phase.  
Client journeys  
To ensure convenient PEP and PrEP access through an online pharmacy , client  journey s were 
developed  based on formative research and conversations with stakeholders , in line with  national 
guidelines and practices .15 In this  model, the client journey begins with a client in need of PrEP or PEP 
logging onto the digital health company’s  web page  and learning about available services.  Figure 2 
summarizes the steps of the journey for clients.  
The digital health company  tested two delivery options: two -step and one -step. Initially, only the two -
step delivery process was offered, with the one -step option added during the pilot to shorten the time 
between conditional PrEP/PEP  prescription and dispensing (especially for PEP clients) and to reduce 
costs to clients  by reducing the number of delivery visits from two to one. By early 2024, the vast 
majority ( approximately 85%) of services were provided via the one -step delivery journey each month.  

 
 
  
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Te chnical considerations and lear nings from Kenya    Page 4  The remaining 15% who continued to  opt for the two-step journey  was due to a preference for 
greater privacy, particularly am ong clients seeking PrEP refill s. These clients did not want to have a 
pharm tech rider wait for the te st to be complet ed and prescrip tion confirmed by a CO* prior to 
dispensing.

delivery model , mapping the steps to  the International AIDS Society  Differentiated Service Delivery 
building blocks . Since the one -step delivery model was much more widely used, th e table in the 
appendix  focuses on that model. In addition, Appendix 4 provides more detail on the client journey 
for one-step delivery.  
Client profiles and preferences related to delivery model  
The telehealth and online pharmacy model in Kenya 
reached clients with a distinct  profile  compared to 
those seeking services at existing clinic -based 
PrEP/PEP delivery  locations . This includes more men, 
unmarried individuals, and clients with sexual partners 
with unknown HIV status, as well as men who have 
sex with men (MSM), who accounted for a sizable 
proportion of PrEP  clients  (22%, or 45/208) clients but 
only 2 % (26/1,549) of PEP clients .2 The proportion of 
PrEP clients who were MSM is notable given that th is 
population is much smaller than the general 
population. While marketing targeted many 
demographic groups who were vulnerab le to HIV, far 
more men than women used the service. Very few clients reported transactional sex or a partner with 
HIV, and the majority of clients had no prior use of PrEP or PEP.  PEP uptake was particularly high, 
mainly driven by clients seeking PrEP , but initiated on PEP instead due to their recent potential HIV 
exposure.  
Privacy was a top consideration for clients choosing to access PrEP or PEP through this online 
pharmacy model . Many clients requested delivery at a location other than their home for privacy 
reasons . One disadvantage of the one -step delivery model was that pharm tech riders needed to wait 
15 minutes for the HIVST  or RDT result before they could dispense PrEP or PEP. In some cases, riders 
waiting for the HIV test result faced harassment from people other than the client (e.g., family 
members  accusing riders of enabling HIV risk behaviors) . One solution was for the riders to wait a 
short distance away from the client’s location  rather than in the immediate vicinity.  
Convenience was another important reason clients gave for choosing th e ePrEP/ ePEP model . The 
digital health company offer ed to deliver orders to a location of the client’s choosing within four 
hours  of submitting their order . 
Costs were lowest for clients who chose the one -step delivery journey with an RDT due to lower 
delivery costs (single visit) and test costs (RDT versus  HIVST). It is unclear whether clients prefer red the 
one-step delivery based on factors other than price. While some clients were willing to pay more for 
the two -step model with HIVST to have the privacy of reading their HIV test  results alone rather than 
having them read by  a pharm tech , the digital health company  report s that the higher -cost two -step 
delive ry model may not be financially sustainable at scale without a subsidy  (see “Business model 
overview ” section) . In contrast, the one -step delivery model with an RDT shows promise as a financially 
sustainable model  (despite requiring a pharm tech rider versus a lay provider) , particularly among 
clients accessing PEP services , as it helped reduce delays for clients within  the 72 -hour post -exposure 
period.  “Because maybe meeting one-on-one 
you might not…you might shy away 
from asking all the questions that you 
have. Maybe you might be shy and not 
confident, but virtually you know you 
are not seeing the person, you are just 
hearing their voice, so I think virtual is 
better than one -on-one meetings.”

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 6  Stakeholder engagement  and policy considerations  
Kenya’s online pharmacy policy pathway  
Kenya has developed several policy documents that 
pave the way for ePrEP/ ePEP services. These include 
the Framework for the Implementation of Pre -Exposure 
Prophylaxis of HIV in Kenya  (2017). The 2023  Private 
Sector Engagement Framework for Delivery of HIV 
Services in Kenya 2023 –2028  also provides a policy 
anchor for use of online pharmacy platforms (linked to 
physical pharmacies or public -sector HIV clinics) to 
deliver PrEP/PEP services . 
In addition, recent policy changes have enabled online 
pharmacy services and delivery of PrEP and PEP 
services through online pharmacies in Kenya, 
including:  
• Guidelines for Internet Pharmacy Services in Kenya  (2022 ) established the policy framework for 
a wide range of services to be delivered through online pharmacies.   
• The update d 2022 version of  the Guidelines on Good Distribution Practices for Medical 
Products and Health Technologies in Kenya  included provisions for online pharmacies, such as 
requirements for online pharmacies to be linked to a Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) –
approved physical pharmacy and pharmacists and pharm techs  to have prescribing rights and 
qualifications approved by the PPB.  
• Kenya’s Digital Health Bill, 2023  further lays the groundwork for scale -up of PrEP and PEP 
provision through online pharmacy platforms  and provides a legislative foundation for digital 
health by recognizing e -health (including telemedicine and telehealth) as a delivery channel.  
• Online pharmacies were noted as an additional PrEP delivery model in t he 2022 revision of the 
Framework for the Implementation of Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV in Kenya .  
The ongoing review of the Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines  in 2024 will present an 
opportunity for policymakers to weigh the evidence and consider inclusion of online pharmacy 
delivery of HIV prevention services  in the national guidelines .  
Policy exemptions for the online pharmacy pilot  
A key goal of this pilot was to provide evidence to inform policy decisions and guideline updates 
related to the inclusion of online pharmacy delivery of PrEP/PEP as a service delivery platform. The 
pilot of this model required policy exemptions , since  a number of the clinical procedures involved are 
not yet the standard of care in Kenya. Jhpiego , a nonprofit global health organization , provided 
advocacy leadership, engaging with NASCOP, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Counci l, 
PPB, and Nairobi and Mombasa Counties as critical stakeholders for policy guidance and support for 
the implementation.  
As of mid -2024 in Kenya, PrEP or PEP prescriptions from  the digital health company used for the pilot  
that are based on an HIVST result and telehealth visit are available only through this research study. 
Through engagement with NASCOP, the pilot study had received an exemption to use HIVST for 
determining PrEP/PEP eligibility, but only in the context of this study. Based on advice from NASCOP, 
RDTs were later incorporated as a second testing option for clients, as the Kenya  HIV Prevention and Considerations for policymakers  
“For PrEP to have impact, programs need 
to be well designed and resourced. The 
first step involves answering questions 
such as, Who is at highest risk for HIV 
acquisition, and to whom will PrEP be 
targeted? How much will this cost? Where 
will resources for  prevention investments 
come from? This information can shape 
national guidelines and policies on PrEP.”

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 7  Treatment Guidelines  did not include HIVST, and evidence was needed to support policy revision that 
would enable scale -up in the context of the existing HIV testing algorithm. During the consent 
process, all clients were informed that using HIVST  to initiate PrEP/PEP or acquiring a prescription for 
the same through a telemedicine visit  is not the standard of care in Kenya . 
NASCOP also provided exemption s for: 
• Assisted HIV testing (either assist ing with the  HIVST or performing the RDT) . 
• PrEP/PEP prescription through telehealth . 
If policies change because of  the evidence generated through the pilot, the model could be replicated 
by others in Kenya with no need to seek exemptions. In other countries, policy changes may be 
needed to enable replication of this model . 
To support the pilot, Kenya Ministry of Health ( MOH ) input included:  
• Government -procured PrEP and PEP commodities through the national supply chain pipeline.  
• Guidance and support in setting up the  clinic associated with the digital health company , 
achiev ing licensing for telehealth services by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists 
Council . 
For more information about the digital health company’s licensure journey, see Appendix 5 . The study 
received institutional review board approval from Kenya’s Scientific and Ethics Review Unit and Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Center , the PPB, the National Commission for Science Technology and Innovation , 
and Nairobi and Mombasa Count ies. 
Capacity -building and quality assurance /improvement  (QA/QI) 
Provider capacity -building and technical support  
Rolling out this model required provider capacity -building and technical support for provision of high-
quality virtual clinical services.  The team collaborated with NASCOP and Nairobi and Mombasa County 
Departments of Health to train a ll COs and pharm tech riders  via a three -day training led by 
experienced PrEP implementors prior to pilot implementation. The team of partners  adapted existing  
national PrEP service delivery training materials and standard operating procedures  to integrate steps 
specific to the digital health company’s online delivery model.  
Training covered the core components of the care pathway for online PrEP/PEP service delivery  
(aligned with standard operating procedures for ePrEP/ePEP provision) , use of the online tools to 
support implementation  and documentation , and MOH reporting requirements for PrEP and PEP 
dispensing . These  includ ed:  
• Prescribing guidelines , including drug interactions, contraindications , and side effects . 
• Virtual counseling on PrEP/PEP , adherence , and sexual - and gender -based violence , including 
use of empathetic counseling to facilitate PrEP adherence and continuation (see Appendix 6).    
• Linkages to HIV care  monitoring and follow -up.  
• Tools to document service delivery (e.g., commodit y reports, referral tracker to record linkages 
to other services).  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 8  Training for p harm tech  riders  was conducted through  
a hybrid approach  that includ ed online modules, 
classroom training, and observed practice during 
practicum , focusing on: 
• RDT administr ation .  
• Commodities management and reporting . 
• Waste management . 
• Infection prevention . 
Routine technical support , continuing medical 
education, and  mentorship was required to ensure 
that providers offer high-quality services and address implementation challenges or gaps related to 
policy updates or changes in service delivery pathways. This support included joint mentorship 
through collaboration with the subcounty health management team s on a bimonthly basis , virtual 
continuing medical education, and learning forums to discuss challenges.  
QA/QI  
QA/QI  was a key component of the pilot in track ing issues on a continuous basis  and show ing 
progress and modifications made to improve service delivery. Partners  collaborated to ensure the 
quality of services provided  and developed a clinical continuous QI plan for client care to help meet 
consumer needs. As part of provider training, t he team  worked closely with  trained HIV Testing Service 
supervisors from  the MOH to  hold observed practice sessions on HIV testing services with  pharm  tech 
riders . During implementation, the riders were  also enrol led in  regular  HIV Testing Service  proficiency 
testing and external quality audits , including batch testing and post -market surveillance of test kits. 
The team  also collaborated with the digital health company’s  providers to map complicated clinical 
situations and provide real -time virtual support and reviews of documented cases through a case 
management approach. Additionally, they enlisted a mental health counselor who engaged pharmacy 
providers and clinicians in sharing their experiences and challenges with service delivery and 
performance.  
Site visits and supervision  from Nairobi and Mombasa Count y personnel also helped ensure 
compliance with guidelines and high-quality service provision, followed by corrective and preventive  
actions , as needed.  The National HIV Reference Laboratory  also supported the pharmacy providers by 
conducting proficiency assessment s with corrective and preventive action . The laboratory  team also 
supported  post-market surveillance by analyzing randomly selected  HIV test kits to  determine  their 
quality.  
Role of AI 
An AI-facilitated digital photo capture and result interpretation system supported the digital health 
company’s  COs to remotely verify client’s  HIVST  results  as described below . 
Assessing and improving  photo  quality  
• Clients were provided with usability -tested visual guidance on how to take a good photo and 
interpret their HIV test s. After administering a test, the client would upload a photo of the test 
and their interpretation of the result .  Evidence supports use of HIVST 
for PrEP  
Scaling up PrEP using HIVST has similar 
health impacts, costs, and low risk of drug 
resistance as those of provider -
administered RDTs. Use of HIVSTs as part 
of six -month PrEP dispensing reduced the 
burden of clinic visits by half, without 
compromising testing, adherence, or 
effective use .16,17 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 9  • The AI system then evaluated the photo quality. If the AI determined the photo to be of poor 
quality or a supported test was not detected,†  the client  was asked to upload a new photo ( up 
to a maximum of three  times) .  
• The AI system also cropped and enhanced images of the result window to enable easier 
interpretation by  COs.  
Assisting CO test interpretation and quality control  
• The AI  system  identified and analyzed test and control lines to support the CO’s interpretation 
and consequent prescription of PrEP/PEP or referral to care.  
• A CO then reviewed the photo of the test, client interpretation, and AI interpretation before 
entering their own interpretation.  
• The AI system was intentionally tuned to be highly  sensitive to faint lines , even though this 
meant  that the  AI gave false positive readings to the CO in some cases , to reduce the risk that 
positive cases would be missed by COs and thus people with HIV mistakenly prescribed PrEP 
or PEP. The AI company  fine-tuned the AI system to improve  its specificity over the course of 
the pilot. 
• When AI and CO interpretation of test results disagreed, the CO was in control of the final 
determination of result. In these cases, the CO proceeded based on their  interpretation , and 
the system flagged the cases for closer examination by  the CO’s supervisor. In almost all cases 
of closer examination, a panel of experts determined that the CO interpretation was correct.  
By integrating AI into this model, the ePrEP Kenya partners aimed to enhance quality control for HIVST 
interpretation.  These procedures align with WHO’s guidance on AI and protecting autonomy, stating 
that AI systems should be designed to assist humans in making informed decisions and allow COs to 
override the AI -generated decisions.18  
Inclusion of AI support for results interpretation was not required by local health authorities or the 
ethical review board . It was  an added feature to support the option of HIVST as part of the telehealth 
prescription of PrEP and PEP. While some clients opted for RDTs performed by pharm tech riders (a 
less expensive testing option for the client), many others chose the added privacy provi ded by the  
HIVST s—even when  delivered by a pharm tech who would wait nearby to dispense PrEP/PEP based on 
the results (one-step proce ss). 
The AI component may have avert ed the need for additional HIVST to be  performed in the cases in 
which the AI flag ged images that need ed to be retaken due to poor image quality. The AI immediately  
flagged poor image quality for approximately 8 % of tests (159  out of approximately 2,000) and 
prompted the clients to take another photo.19 Since the digital health company  did not  offer PrEP/PEP 
based on HIVST without AI, we do not know what would have happened without AI in cases of poor 
image quality.  
AI also facilitated the digital health company's monitoring  of HIV test interpretation by COs, 
prompting the respective CO supervisor to audit cases where AI and CO interpretation varied rather 
 
† Initially, the only supported tests were the Mylan and Sure Check ® HIV Self Test kits (Sure Check is a registered 
trademark of Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.) . The AI support for the digital health platform was extended in 
2023 to include  the Abbott Determine ™ RDT, used by MYDAWA pharm tech riders.  Nearly all WHO -prequalified 
HIVSTs  are now supported by the digital health platform  in Kenya , but they were not all included in the study 
protocol for this pilot and thus are not yet part of the ePrEP/ ePEP offering . AI is capable of supporting a wide 
variety of tests following an investment in  AI integration.  
 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 10  than requir ing the CO to observ e every single case. Discrepancies between AI and CO interpretation 
also helped indicate when certain COs needed additional training.  
The costs of the AI component included an upfront cost of AI development for each HIV test 
supported in the model and ongoing  costs for technology support , including troubleshooting. The 
upfront cost was high relative to ongoing costs  and was covered by the donor.  The cost of AI per 
client declines as the model scales , but AI remains a substantial component of overall  per-client costs . 
Additional costs would be incurred to train the AI on new HIVST products as they enter the market.  
The pilot study was not designed to test whether AI improved CO performance or to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of AI, which came with a cost that may not be feasibl y cover ed in all ePrEP/ ePEP 
models.   
Linkage s to care  and follow -up support  
Clients who test HIV positive must be  linked to care in accordance with  the Kenya HIV Prevention and 
Treatment Guidelines . During the pilot study, seven  clients who had reactive HIVST results  were 
counseled by a CO during a follow -up call on the importance of confirmatory testing and provided 
with an active referral  to a health facilit y of their choice for retesting and  follow -on care. Of those, 
three clients were confirmed true positive , and the other  four were confirmed negative.  To maximize 
linkage s to care,  it is critical t o map pharmacies offering ePrEP services and to connect clients with 
health facilities offering HIV care services within their respective areas. 
In addition, c lients in need of PrEP /PEP services who had p reexisting chronic conditions that could 
affect the kidneys or liver were referred to physical facilities for further assessment, close clinical 
monitoring , and potential initiation of Pr EP. All clients also were assessed for adverse drug reactions 
associated with PrEP/PEP  and, if needed , reported  through  MOH pharmacovigilance tools and referred 
appropriately to specialized care, in accordance with the Kenya  HIV Prevention and Treatment 
Guidelines . An adverse drug reaction was only recorded for one ePEP client during the pilot, who was 
referred to a health facility for follow -up care.  
New clients preferred calls to initiate PrEP, while follow -up clients preferred  WhatsApp (over emails)  
for support.  The trends of client s who dropped off and did not finish their medication for both PEP 
and PrEP service w ere not different than those of other delivery platforms. When asked by COs,  clients 
tended to attribute their  discontinuation  to side effects , pill burden , and (for PrEP ) changes in 
behaviors associated with HIV risk .

💡 Key learnings : Program model   
• The model reached clients with a distinct profile compared to clients  seeking services at clinic -
based PrEP/PEP delivery locations . PEP uptake was high, mainly  driven  by clients initially 
seeking PrEP who were instead initiated on PEP due to recent potential HIV exposure.   
• Some PEP clients submitted an order through the online pharmacy platform when they were 
close to the end of their 72 -hour window. The one -step delivery client journey and 
communication between COs and pharm tech riders helped reduce the risk of missing this 
window by making the test and PEP available during the same visit.  Median time between 
exposure and PEP delivery was 39 hours .2  
• AI prompt ed clients to take a clear image of their HIVST results if the one they uploaded was 
of low quality. AI also supported COs as they remotely interpreted photographed results of 
clients’ HIVST, providing a second opinion to consider. This also enabled a CO’s supervisor to 
check for possible misinterpretation by examining the very rare discrepancies between AI and 
CO test interpretation.  
• QA and quality checks for PEP and PrEP commodities were critical to ensuring that 
commodities were stored in a manner that align s with MOH standards.  
  


 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 12  👍 Recommendations : Program model  
• Start with an implementation roadmap . Appendix 2 provides a checklist of key topics that 
stakeholders should consider while planning to introduce the ePrEP/ ePEP model. Responses 
to these questions can inform a customized ePrEP/ ePEP introduction roadmap for partners’ 
use during the ePrEP/ ePEP setup  phase.  
• Understand that w hile a single end -to-end digital health platform provided both 
telehealth services and online pharmacy del iveries in this model, integration of these 
components is not a requirement . If telehealth and online pharmacy services are provided 
by separate companies, they can work together : clients can upload their telehealth 
prescriptions on the online pharmacy platform when ordering products. Start -up costs may be 
lower if existing telehealth and online pharmacy platforms are leveraged.  
• Be aware that i n most policy contexts, this approach to PrEP and PEP delivery is not yet 
a standard of care or included within existing policies and guidelines . If existing policies 
do not allow for ePrEP/ ePEP, then policy revisions will be needed for service delivery that 
differ s from approved, standard -of-care processes covered by existing policies and guidelines . 
For example, if the model includes initiation of oral PrEP/PEP based on HIVST instead of an 
RDT, an online pharmacy may need to seek an exempti on or advocate for change to policy 
guidelines  enabling  use of HIVST for PrEP/PEP initiation.  
• Tailor the model to epidemic and population needs . Given the financial resources 
potentially required to establish ePrEP/ ePEP model s, selection of target geographies is 
important. Countries should consider drivers of HIV transmission , current prevalence rates , 
and hot spots to identify where HIV prevention efforts should be ramped up, including 
additional access points to PrEP services.  It is critical to consider internet connectivity and 
willingness to pay in these geographies as well.  
• Establish systems for virtual and in -person supportive supervision of telehealth 
providers and delivery riders, quality controls for commodities, and post -market 
surveillance . As resources allow, consider integrating AI -assisted diagnostics to make HIVST 
results easier for telehealth providers to interpret and facilitate supervisors’ monitoring of 
results interpretations.  
• Establish a client journey that maximizes privacy, convenience, and speed while 
minimizing costs . A one -step model is recommended due to lower costs, as only one 
delivery is needed per client, saving rider time and fuel and enabling the lower -cost option of 
an RDT administered by a qualified rider as an alternative to HIVST.  
• Guarantee pharm tech rider safety by requiring clients to provide a safe location and 
prioritiz ing daytime travel to locations deemed unsafe after certain hours . As an 
additional option, telehealth companies could explore whether HIVST and PrEP/PEP access 
through e -lockers might reach clients for a low cost and with fewer safety concerns for riders. 
Implementation research is needed to understand the feasibility of using e -lockers for PrEP 
and PEP, as this was not part of the ePrEP Kenya study.  
• For RDT s, ensure that the riders who administer tests carry all necessary medical  
supplies  (i.e., consumables  such as  buffer  and lancets and additional tests in case of faulty 
testing ). Test consumables must be packed in a portable sterile package.  
• Establish linkage protocols and recording referrals on a referral tracker  to ensure that 
clients who test HIV positive or need other care access the recommended care.

Business model  and sustainability 
considerations  
The value proposition for  online pharmacies to 
integrate ePrEP/ ePEP services into their online 
platforms is two -fold: (1) facilitating greater choice, 
comfort, and confidentiality  for clients  in receiving  
PrEP/PEP by offering  online services  (appointment 
booking , consultations , e-prescription , ordering 
system) , product delivery, and a choice of HIV test 
kits; and ( 2) offering clients access to other telehealth 
services and commodities (beyond HIV prevention) 
through one access point.   
As ePrEP/PEP is envisioned to be commercially self -
sustaining, online pharmacy platforms should develop 
a business model and conduct a business 
sustainability analysis (see Appendix 7) to understand 
the financial sustainability of integrating ePrEP/ePEP into their platform. Appendix 8 presents a high -
level illustrative business model for ePrEP/ePEP services in Kenya, with details provided below on cost-
related assumptions and service metrics that should be considered while assessing the long -term 
financial viability of integrating ePrEP/PEP services .

“I think [ePrEP/PEP] is quite good, I 
don’t think that I would have gotten it, 
otherwise the process of getting the 
medication physically, the logistics can 
be quite challenging…even the stories 
that I have heard of people when they 
go to visit clinics, may be even the 
judgement that you might get from the 
person who is serving you with 
something similar. So, with the online, 
one, I think it is very convenient, two, I 
think it provides a sense of 
confidentiality and safety.”

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 14  Cost and revenue details  
Involved costs  
Labor and operational costs :  
• Costs associated with running ePrEP/ ePEP services —such as salaries ( COs, pharm techs, lay 
riders , etc.), equipment, and overhead costs (office operations , technology expenses , etc.) —
directly impact overall profitability. These are generally fixed costs that would increase over 
time as demand grows for ePrEP/ ePEP and other offered services and products.  
• Within this pilot, average monthly salaries for COs and pharm techs were 120,000 KES  
(US$927 .00) and 80,000 KES  (US$618 .00), respectively, inclusive of benefits.  
• In addition to ongoing operational costs for running ePrEP/ ePEP services, there would also be 
initial start -up costs that online p harmacies may need to secure seed funding to cover . These 
costs could be for developing an ePrEP/ ePEP online platform (for entities that do not have an 
existing telehealth/e -commerce platform) or conducting demand  generation campaigns.  
• The number of staff needed is determined by the number of consultations a CO can conduct 
during a shift and the number of deliveries of PrEP/PEP prescriptions or test kits a pharm tech 
or lay rider can deliver. Average consultation time by a pharm tech rider is 30 minutes 
(excluding delivery time ), and average consultation time by a clinician is 30 minutes per client . 
Initial ePrEP/ ePEP consultations are 30 minutes compared to 5 minutes for refill consultation 
visits. Each clinician is required to conduct 800 consultations per quarter (approximately 266 
consultations each month ).  
• Incremental increases in personnel enable the model to be scalable over time as demand and 
revenue increases. Personnel increases also could ensure better quality as more clients enroll 
in the service, and the increased number of staff would enable more clients to be seen, thus 
increasing both PrEP/PEP and non -PrEP/PEP sales.  
• Entities considering ePrEP/ ePEP platforms could explore the possibility of alternative delivery 
options based on operating contexts, such as delivery lock ers (e-lockers) t hat could 
potentially reduce delivery -associated costs  or be more aligned with client preferences (for 
clients who may not want PrEP or PEP delivered directly to their homes) .  
Commodity procurement s:  
• Costs for the HIV RDTs or HIVST s online  made  up a large portion of the costs of this delivery 
model , as the digital health company directly procured the tests  at market price .‡ PrEP and 
PEP would have increased costs significantly had they not been donated by the government.   
• To reduce out -of-pocket payments by clients, governments or external donors could  supply 
online pharmacy platforms  with donated  commodities  (HIVSTs, RDTs, PrEP, and PEP ) for either 
all clients or just clients with financial need .  
• Without donated product, pharmacies would have to procure all commodities on the market 
or through available government procurement mechanisms, such as  those outlined in  Kenya's 
Private Sector Engagement Framework  for Delivery of HIV Services , which could offer 
commodities at lower rates through pooled procurement mechanism s (see the “ Commodity 
access ” section below for further details).  
 
‡ In February 2024, the Kenyan government donated RDTs to the digital health company.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 15  Revenue  
Consultations : 
• Offering free ePrEP/ ePEP consultations initially may be advantageous to generate client 
demand. In the long run, free consultations may not be financially viable  for online pharmacy 
platform s unless the cost of telehealth consultation is integrated  into either the costs of  PrEP 
and PEP s old through the online pharmacy or the delivery fees .  
• The digital health company did not charge consultation fees in either phase 1 or 2 , but has 
plans  for an eventual shift to a tiered consulta tion fee, with  a higher cost for initiation visits 
(approximately  30 minutes) versus PrEP follow -up visits (approximately 5 minutes).  
• Introducing an ePrEP/ ePEP consultation charge could create space for ePrEP/ ePEP services to 
generate additional revenue beyond product sales , but would come with the risk of deterring 
clients from seeking a consultation before they know ing whether they are eligible for PrEP or 
PEP. (The rationale behind consultations is addressed in the pricing strategy section of the 
digital health company’s  business case report. )20 
• Alternatively, consultation costs could be  supported by national or private health insurance  
through government -support mechanisms or donor s, at least as  a short  term  solution .  
PrEP/PEP and HIV test kit sales and delivery :  
• Online pharmacies  may charge  client s for PrEP, PEP, and HIV RDTs or HIVST s, with prices set 
based on unit cost , paid by the platform for the commodity , weighed  against price controls 
and client willingness  to pay to ensure affordability.  Unit costs for PrEP, PEP , and HIV test kits 
could be subject to shifts to align with market -driven pricing variances . Figure 3 summarizes 
the total cost paid by clients during each phase of the ePrEP/ ePEP pilot.  
• Donated products (i.e., donated PrEP or PEP by the government  or external funders ) may have 
restrictions on the donation that preclude the online pharmacy platform from charging costs 
to the client for the commodity itself. Due to a government donation of generic PrEP or PEP, 
the digital health company did not charge clients for PrEP or PEP during phases 1 and 2.  
• Due to the need for RDTs to be administered by a health care provider, online pharmacy 
platforms could charge a test administration fee. During the pilot, the digital health company 
charged an RDT administration fee of 675 KES  (US$5.21 ).  
• Clients could be charged a delivery fee to  offset the associated labor costs for a pharm tech 
rider or lay rider to deliver the commodities ( i.e., HIV tests; PrEP or PEP) . During the pilot, the 
digital health company charged a 149 KES  (US$1.15 ) delivery fee in Nairobi and offered free 
delivery in Mombasa (due to the smaller geographic area  and thus shorter travel times). 
Clients who opted for the two -step model had to pay the delivery fee twice, adding to the 
total cost to the client.  
• The digital health company also offered clients the option of upload ing prescriptions issued 
by other/non -telehealth providers and purchas ing PrEP and PEP from their online platfor m at 
market rate  (30-day oral PrEP course  for 7,740 KES  or US $59.77  [Truvada]; and 28-day PEP 
course  for 3,700  KES or US $28.57  [Acriptega]). Offering generic PrEP and PEP for sale would 
enhance their affordability , reducing costs to  725 KES  (US$5.60 ) for generic PrEP  and 425 KES  
(US$3.28 ) for generic PEP).

and 2.  
 
Abbreviations: ePrEP/ePEP, online pharmacy service delivery of PrEP/PEP; HIVST, HIV self -testing; PEP, post -exposure 
prophylaxis; PrEP, pre -exposure prophylaxis; RDT, rapid diagnostic test.  
During the development of this model, the University of Washington led a discrete choice experiment 
with 772 survey respondents to understand client willingness  to pay. They concluded that potential 
clients would be comfortable paying a median value of 1,059 KES (US$ 8.10) to access ePrEP for one 
month (inclusive of any fees for the consultation, HIV testing, PrEP product, and delivery).21  This 
willingness  to pay amount is very similar to the actual amount paid by clients in phase 2 if they chose 
an RDT rather than HIVST, and it would also be similar for HIVST clients if they could access the lower -
cost HIVST option that was out of stock for most of phase 2. However, if clients will need to pay for 
PrEP itself (or PEP), the cost to clients in the future will exceed the median willingness -to-pay from this 
initial study. It will be important to track how sales volumes change if this additional cost to cl ients 
does  get incorporated in the future.   
Other model considerations  
Pull-through revenue from other pharmaceutical products and prescriptions  
• One potential  revenue stream is to diversify beyond ePrEP /ePEP  and offer  other products and 
services to clients as they visit the online pharmacy or participate in consultations , where staff 
can convert prescriptions or suggest products beyond ePrEP/ePEP .  
• During phase 2, the revenue from a client buying ePrEP /ePEP  services was only less than half 
of the revenue the  digital health company  generated from the average cart for general health 
consultations that did not include ePrEP /ePEP .  
• The digital health company  has not tracked pull -through revenue for ePrEP /ePEP , nor ha s it 
tried to advertise other products , such as emergency contraception and condoms to clients 
buying ePrEP /ePEP  services. However, the  company has  seen the sales of non -ePrEP /ePEP  
services grow over the course of this pilot.  


 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 17  • Understanding pull -through revenue and strategically working to increase it could contribute 
to the financial  sustainability of ePrEP /ePEP  and support clients in access ing other primary 
health care services they need.  
Service use and performance metrics  
• The business sustainability model requires data for evaluating business performance, tracking 
growth, understanding service demand, and measuring impact on revenue and profit. To aid  
with this, online pharmac ies should develop and integrate metrics into ePrEP /ePEP  models to 
continuously gather these data  to inform sustainability modeling. Appendix 7 provides a 
template for a business sustainability analysis.  
• Data that online pharmacies  should consider collecting include:   
o Number of ePrEP /ePEP  consultations provided.  
o Number of prescriptions dispensed (disaggregated by PrEP or PEP  and generic or 
nongeneric).  
o Type of HIV test kits ordered as part of ePrEP /ePEP  service package (disaggregated by 
HIVST or RDT kit and by kit model ). 
o Value  of other pharmaceutical products or services purchased by ePrEP /ePEP  clients on 
the online pharmacy platform.  
• Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of staff performance and service quality is essential for 
ensuring financial health —namely , considerations related to the ability of COs to be efficient 
in their  work without compromising service quality. Therefore, o nline pharmac ies should 
consider  doing the following :  
o Conduct periodic performance reviews (at least semi annually) of COs and pharm tech 
riders to discover areas in need of follow -up to  improve efficiency , as well as to  identify 
high performers who could be placed on a career growth/development plan  and low 
performers who could be placed on a performance improvement plan.  
o Gather client feedback to understand client satisfaction with service quality and identify 
gap areas that may impact client continuity and retention.  
• An AI-assisted HIVST component assists clinical supervisors with performance reviews and 
may improve  COs’ accuracy by providing back -up support to their interpretations. However, 
false positive readings from the AI increased cost due to the need to follow  up discrepant 
results.  The AI system was initially tuned to be highly sensitive to detect faint lines, which 
resulted in a high number of false positive readings. (COs used their own interpretations, but 
these cases of discrepancies between AI and CO interpretation were flagged for further 
investigation by the COs’ supervisors.) Fine-tuning  the AI system  over time improved its 
accuracy.  
Net profitability of ePrEP /ePEP   
Based on current demand levels , cost/fee structures,  and the resulting revenues, the digital health 
company ’s business sustainability model indicates that its ePrEP /ePEP  service delivery model can 
break even or make  a small  profit.  PrEP, PEP, and HIV tests made up a large proportion of the digital 
health company’s sales initially . As the company added products and services  with higher margins , it 
was able to improve overall profits.  Growth in general  health consultations , prescriptions , and product 
sales can lead to  consistent revenue growth to support the relatively low profits generated through 
the ePrEP /ePEP  model.

ePrEP /ePEP  client bas e. Online p harmacies and 
governments should explore the possibility of 
covering certain ePrEP /ePEP  costs through national 
health insurance schemes (e.g., ePrEP /ePEP  
consultation fees; HIV test kits or PrEP/PEP 
commodities). Increasing  the number of clients 
using the platform could lead to reduced operating 
costs from economies of scale, thus potentially 
increasing  profits  generated by  ePrEP /ePEP  services 
alone.   
Commodity access and public/private supply chain linkages  
Current model  
During the pilot , the digital health company  received  donated PEP and PrEP commodities from  the 
MOH  in the context of this research ; the company  was linked to  the national commodities pipeline  as 
a satellite site to subcounty health facilities in the counties of Nairobi (Westlands Subcounty Hospital) 
and Mombasa (Kaderbhouy Health Centre).  
Continued availability of public ly procured  PrEP and PEP doses  was driven by submission of monthly 
PrEP/PEP commodity reports to the respective linked subcounty health facilit y in Nairobi or Mombasa . 
A standard operating procedure was developed to guide the digital health company’s  team in 
generat ing the  required monthly commodity reports in alignment with MOH expectations . Subcounty 
pharmacists conduct ed quarterly checks at the study sites  for QA and quality control related to 
commodity receipt, storage conditions, and reporting processes. The steps taken  to access public -
sector PrEP and PEP stocks for ePrEP /ePEP  clients during phase  1 of the pilot study  are summarized 
below :  
1. The digital health company  extracted data for monthly stock and client counts.  
2. These data  were then shared with the respective CO supervisor , who calculated the necessary 
resupply quantity and submitted the final monthly reports to each subcounty health facility.  
3. Each subcounty health facility  reviewed the submitted monthly report to determine the quantity 
for replenishment by Nairobi and Mombasa’s respective subcounty hospitals.  
4. The subcounty hospitals then submitted reports to the Kenya Health Information System.  
Vision for commodity su pply in the  future  
With the launch of Kenya’s  Private Sector Engagement Framework for Delivery of HIV Services , in the 
near term, private -sector actors will be able to receive donated commodities procured via the M OH 
and dispense them to clients at a nominal dispensing fee. In the long  term, private -sector partners will 
be able to source commodities through a pooled procurement mechanism with technical support 
from the government of Kenya and implementing partners to benefit from economies of scale. It is 
expected that cost savings due to increased purchasing power and efficiencies resulting in competitive 
pricing will be passed on to the cli ents who access private -sector HIV services. In settings without a 
private -sector engagement framework, a fully commercial model may be possible depending on costs 
and client willingness and ability to pay.  “With PEP and PrEP continuing to be 
donated by the county government, 12% 
of our business is PEP and PrEP as of 
April 2024. It contributes to our business, 
but we’re also doing it to meet a need. 
For the patients, we don’t want to switch 
off this source of  access, especially for 
those who are continuing on PrEP.”   
 
–— Dr. Samira Abdulrashid,  
Medical Officer In -charge, MYDAWA

💡 Key learnings : Business model  
• The ePrEP /ePEP  model offers dual benefits for online pharmacies: (a) making a social impact 
through addressing a critical health need for clients and (b) opening new or expanding 
existing revenue streams to reach new customers.  
• The number of ePrEP /ePEP  consultations remained steady (despite the anticipated decrease in 
demand) after the digital health company shifted to charging market rates for HIV test kits 
following the removal of subsidies  for this commodity . It remains to be seen how demand 
might change if clients need to start paying for PEP and PrEP in the future ; subcounty 
governments continue d to donate these products for phase 2 of the study.  
• The digital health company’s business sustainability model indicates that ePrEP /ePEP  will 
break even or make a small profit, assuming the same fee structure and level of client demand 
as observed during the pilot. However, the potential for pull-through revenue from general 
health consultations and resulting prescription and product sales may support consistent 
revenue growth , making the continued offer of  ePrEP /ePEP  services viable for the company 
post-study . 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 20  👍 Recommendations : Business model  
• Secure seed investments  to cover upfront costs associated with developing the ePrEP /ePEP  
online platform (if an online pharmacy platform does not yet exist), optional AI -assisted HIV 
testing (if desired), and support  for demand generation to drive awareness and establish a 
robust client base for ePrEP /ePEP .    
• Identify a source of HIV tests and HIV prevention commodities , and then set consumer 
prices  that balance affordability with financial sustainability, factoring in any relevant price 
controls.  
• Before  integrating an ePrEP /ePEP  model  into current services , simulat e a business 
sustainability analysis  (see template in Appendix 7) to understand the longer -term financial 
viability of  such integrati on, as well as  whether  and when ePrEP /ePEP  could be commercially 
self-sustaining.  
• Adjust pricing based on evolving market conditions , as was done by the digital health 
company when market HIVST  prices dramatically increased midway through the pilot. 
However, pricing is a delicate balance between ensuring price points are affordable and 
aligned with client s’ willingness  to pay while remaining competitive in the market and 
ensuring profitability. Reinforcing demand generation to increase clients’ perceived value of 
PrEP and PEP could help to mitigate higher commodity costs due to market sh ifts.  
• Position ePrEP /ePEP  as part of the platform’s broader telehealth capability , helping to 
broaden the client base beyond those interested in HIV prevention services and diversify 
revenue streams by attracting repeat customers for both HIV prevention and other health  care 
needs. To enhance commercial viability of ePrEP /ePEP  services, online pharmacies need to 
consider and offer other products ePrEP /ePEP  clients may need during consultation 
appointments and/or as part of a bundled package§ for various client types/needs (e.g., 
bundling PrEP and family planning, offering reduced or free HIV test kits to PEP clients 
interested in PrEP to encourage transition etc.) . 
• Collect  continuous and updated data (from both ePrEP /ePEP  and pull -through [non -
ePrEP /ePEP ] revenue)  to evaluate  business performance, track growth, understand service 
demand, and measur e impact on revenue and profit as part of business sustainability 
modeling. Metrics to gather these data  should be developed and integrated into the 
ePrEP /ePEP  model.  
• Conduct o ngoing monitoring and evaluation of the model’s effectiveness (uptake , 
continuity)  and staff performance  (COs, pharm tech riders, lay riders) , as well as  elicit ing 
client feedback on services to assess the level of CO efficiency and service quality and make 
adjustments to implementation of the model , as needed .   
• Consider i ncremental increases in personnel  to be  incorporated  over time based on client 
demand and revenue increases, to maintain service quality and increase the staffing footprint , 
enabl ing more clients to be seen and thus further driving both PrEP/PEP and non -PrEP/PEP 
sales.  
 
§ Bundling was not part of the model tested in Kenya.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 21  Demand generation  
The JiPrEP  campaign  
The overarching goal of the project’s  demand  
generation strategy was to raise awareness, 
educate the target audience, and drive adoption 
of PrEP  and PEP, leading to an increas e in access 
to, uptake of, and continuation of PrEP/PEP by 
individuals at risk of HIV acquisition.22 The 
online platform was positioned as a reliable, 
accessible, and confidential source for obtaining 
PrEP or PEP, while also destigmatizing use of the 
medication by promoting marketing materials 
to a wide variety of audiences , including less 
stigmatized groups . 
Initially, marketing  focused  entirely  on PrEP , 
with PEP added later in the campaign . Called  
JiPrEP mapema ndio best  (“Early PrEP is best ”), 
the campaign was developed with insights from 
Nigeria’s  Gen-N PrEP program, global PrEP 
programs, and focus group  discussion (FGD)  
feedback. Marketing  focused on  reframing PrEP 
as a contribution to a higher cause by creating a 
movement: join  the Gen-N community  (Figure 
4). Gen-N refers to the “HIV -negative 
generation.”  
The marketing strategy had four goals:  
• Increase PrEP product and brand 
awareness.  
• Drive engagement and conversations 
on the JiPrEP  online  platform.  
• Generate interest in and drive traffic to the PrEP website.  
• Promote PrEP use and continuation.  
Marketing  strategy development and deployment  
Marketing activities initially were rolled out in Nairobi  County and  then expanded to Mombasa 
County. Demand  generation strategy development and deployment had several components , as 
outlined below.  
Audience segmentation and channels  
The target market was individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition who could benefit from accessing 
PrEP and PEP through the e -commerce platform , particularly middle -class Kenyans with disposable 
income and a  reliable  internet connection. This included AGYW, serodiscordant couples, MSM, female 
Figure  4. Promotional  content  for Gen-N. 


 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 22  sex workers , and other at -risk populations. The existing pharmacy customer base  was included , with 
the goal of destigmatizing the use of PrEP through education.  
The digital health company team  conducted a market analysis to profile the  target  audiences , and 
data on demographic s, behavior s, engagement, and attitud es were used to further segment these 
audiences.  Specifically, d emographics such as  gender, age, education level, and location  were 
assessed . Behavioral data consisted of  purchase history, user attention on the platform, and devices 
used for browsing . Engagement data included users' interactions with the platform, likes and shares 
on social media, conversions, click -through rate s, and website traffic. Attitudinal data included 
motivations and challenges, preferences, and customer satisfaction.  Several data sources were 
reviewed —mainly , previous campaign profile reports ; FGDs, reviews,  and other  feedback  source s; and 
analytical tools , including Google Analytics and heat maps.   
To avoid relying heavily on a single marketing channel, the team considered which media channels 
would support their objectives. The channel selection process drew from similar campaigns’ market 
insights , as well as internal data analysis. In particular, learnings from Nigeria’s Ni Gen -N campaign 
informed the channel selection and activities. The team leveraged  an array of strategic channels 
including billboards, radio, social media , internet search engines, influencers, interpersonal 
communication, and pos ters. The most successful  channels included adult sites, Google Search ads, 
and Facebook.   
Initial asset development and FGDs 
To understand what content and artwork would appeal to the target audience, the team organized 
FGDs to obtain feedback on marketing materials. This feedback was collated based on cohorts of 
populations prioritized in Kenya’s national PrEP scale -up efforts , which included MSM, female sex 
workers, AGYW , and serodiscordant couples, a s well as the general population.  
Feedback heard across the groups indicated that the messaging should be positive, focusing on 
relationships and empowerment rather than messaging primarily about  risk. Additionally, p articipants 
express ed a desire to see photos of people that resemble Kenyans rather than individuals from other 
countries or regions.  They also felt that offering informational videos through the digital health 
company’s online platform would help better explain the user journey .  
Based on focus group feedback, the team revised the draft content to include positive language, 
photos depicting Kenyans, and testimonials, as well as educational content on the difference between 
PEP and PrEP. The team also developed instructional videos about PEP and PrEP , along with 
instructions for uploading HIVST images through the platform.  
When developing materials, the team worked closely with internal and external regulatory experts , 
such as the PPB , to ensure that all marketing content and strategies were compliant with regulations.  
Campaign launch  
The team held both  “soft” and “hard” campaign launch es. The soft launch included publishing a press 
release announcing the project, social media adverts, and flyers in product packages for customers 
who purchased HIVSTs and emergency contraceptives.  The soft launch enabled the team to identify 
and address any bugs in the online pharmacy platform, ensuring smooth operation in a live 
environment. They also recognized the need for staff with a broader skillset, including experience in 
demand  generation strateg y. As a result, rather than hiring a digital marketer as originally planned, the  
team  opted for a telehealth marketing manager with expertise in strategy creation and 
implementation.  The hard launch was conducted approximately two months  later.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 23  Refreshed demand  generation strategy  
While there was high uptake for PEP, but an initial  low PrEP  uptake, the team reviewed the strategy 
and conducted market research to better understand the current landscape. They concluded  that a 
strategy refresh was needed . One key issue was  that d igital marketing tactics needed to expand to 
provide multiple touchpoints through which the target audience s can engage.  Product demand was 
not generally correlated  with marketing spending and was often more influenced by awareness -
building activities such as soc ial media engagement , influencer outreach , and on -the-ground events.  
They also found that the  campaign provided insufficient  information about the client journey.  
The new strategy included the following changes:  
• It provid ed accurate  information to dispel  myths and negative perceptions through targeted 
marketing to key audiences.  
• It expand ed the  marketing channels and tactics to educate  audiences and  create 
opportunities  and motivation for action . 
• It prioritiz ed raising awareness to ensure that the general population understands basic facts 
about PrEP and does not associate it only with certain populations.  
Client engagement  and insights   
As noted above, marketing content focused on PrEP rather than PEP, and many clients confused the 
two products when initially seeking services. While n early all clients requested PrEP during their initial 
consultation, because most had been exposed to HIV within the pr eceding  72 hours , they need ed to 
use PEP before transitioning to PrEP.  A key recommendation  for future demand  generation efforts is 
to promote both  PrEP and PEP  in the same advertisements , with simpl e and clear language  
highlighting the distinction between the two . In particular,  demand  generation campaigns should 
reinforce  clients ’ understanding of the brief window for PEP effectiveness to ensure they  access the 
product  within 72 hours of HIV exposure , while also highlighting the value of PrEP as an HIV 
prevention method for those with ongoing exposure to HIV . The current marketing  campaign is 
featured on the Gen-N website . 
💡 Key learnings : Demand generation  
• Clients commonly confused PrEP and PEP when initially seeking services, and all online 
advertising focused on PrEP, not PEP. While nearly all clients requested PrEP during the initial 
consultation, because most clients had been exposed within 72 hours, the y needed to use PEP 
before considering transitioning to PrEP.  
👍 Recommendations : Demand generation  
• To help clients correctly identify which product they need and access PEP quickly if needed,  
online pharmacies should promote both PrEP and PEP products  in the same 
advertisements , using simple language to clarify the distinction between the two and  
highlighting the brief window for PEP effectiveness for clients with potential  recent  exposure 
to HIV , as well as  the value of PrEP as a protective method for people with potential ongoing 
exposure.  
• Marketing should be tailored to target audiences and messaging should be positive , 
focusing on relationships and empowerment rather than negative messages primarily about 
risk. 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 24  Overall l earnings  and recommendations  
Implementation research provided several insights into client profiles, the one -step delivery model, 
the role of AI in QA, and long -term sustainability of the model.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses of 
the study are ongoing and will be reported in more detail by the researcher s in forthcoming 
publications . Key findings that have been presented at academic conferences are highlighted below.  
Programmatic and research learnings  
Formative research can inform the design of the care pathway for ePrEP/ePEP services to 
ensure  the approach  aligns with stakeholder and user preferences  
• Researchers  engaged stakeholders from implementing, governmental, research, and private -
sector organizations to design a care pathway for online delivery of PrEP and PEP services. 
This care pathway was based on an experimental care pathway for the delivery of PrEP and 
PEP services at brick -and-mortar pharmacies in Kenya.  
• Researchers  conducted a discrete choice experiment among potential online pharmacy users  
in Nairobi  (n = 772) and found that participants preferred remote clinical consultation, HIVST, 
and phone /SMS user support —which emphasized that they value  privacy in their HIV 
prevention care  but want the option of speaking to COs for support, if needed.   
• The median maximum that participants  were willing  to pay for a package of online PrEP 
delivery services was 1 ,059 KES, or US$ 8.10 (interquartile range  [IQR] $6.50 -$15.80 ).21  
Online pharmacy delivery of PrEP /PEP service s was feasible to offer in urban Kenya and 
acceptable to clients  
• The model reached  1,549 PEP and 208 PrEP clients over 14 months (from October 19, 2022 , 
through December 31, 2023 ), an average of more than  100 PrEP or PEP clients per month .2 
• Most  clients ( over 90%) found online  PrEP/PEP delivery acceptable and indicated high 
satisfaction with the approach . The mean  Client Satisfaction Questionnaire  (CSQ-8 ) score for 
PrEP clients was 31.6 ( standard deviation [ SD]: 1.02) and for PEP clients , 31.4 (SD: 1.32 ). Most 
clients ( over 85%) reported  a positive experience with different components  of the model , 
including the remote CO consultation, HIV test order and delivery, HIVST upload, and drug  
delivery .  
Online delivery reached PrEP - and PEP -naïve populations with vulnerability to HIV 
exposure  that are distinct from those accessing PrEP and PEP services at public clinics  
• Few online PrEP clients had previously used PrEP (17 %) or PEP (14 %); similarly, only 1 % of 
online PEP clients had ever used PrEP , and 14 % had previously used PEP.  
• Most client s accessing online PrEP and PEP services were over 25 years old, male, and 
unmarried ; reported multiple sex partners ; and/or did not know the HIV status of their sexual 
partners .2 This is in contrast  to PrEP clients at public clinics in Kenya, most of whom tend to be 
female, married, and in established HIV serodi scordan t relationships.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 25  Contrary to expectations, the pilot saw much higher online delivery of PEP compared  to 
PrEP; continuation of both  ePrEP and ePEP services  was low  
• Online PEP uptake was more than  7 times higher than that of PrEP over the  pilot’s duration.2 
This aligns with the digital health company’s contraceptive product sales : emergency 
contraceptive and condom sales far exceed those  for daily , oral contraceptive pills.    
• Any PrEP continuation over the pilot duration  (14 months)  was 47 %, with 42 % continuation at 
1 month , down to  14% at 7 mont hs.2 PrEP continuation with the online delivery approach is 
similar to that observed with the standard clinic -based delivery approach in Kenya. The most 
common reasons for online PrEP discontinuation —according to the digital health company’s 
COs—were side effects, pill burden,  and change s in clients’ perceived likelihood of a future 
HIV exposure.   
• Any repeat use of online PEP over the pilot duration was 13 %, with 6 % of PEP clients 
transitioning to online PrEP services and 7 % returning to refill PEP via the online delivery 
platform.2 Most online PEP clients said they did not anticipate another HIV exposure and did 
not see a need for PrEP. The percentage of  PEP clients that transitioned to PrEP increased over 
the duration of pilot implementation , from  2% (3 of 147 clients)  in quarter  4 (Q4) 2022 to 12 % 
(49 of 405 clients) in Q4 2023 , after the COs were trained on  empathy -based counseling.  
Facilitators of and barriers to ePrEP/ePEP remain, which could be addressed  with novel 
implementation strategies  
• Privacy was a top consideration for clients using this model. Very few clients turned on their 
video during their telehealth visit with the remote provider , and many requested that the 
product s be delivered to a location other than home.  
• Most PEP clients accessed online services within 72 hours of HIV exposure; only 37 
prospective clients were not eligible for online PEP because the y exceeded  the 72-hour  
window . The average time from HIV exposure to PEP service delivery was 39 hours (IQR 25 –
51). Online pharmacies should emphasize the brief window for PEP effectiveness to ensure 
clients in need do not delay accessing online PEP services.2  
• Qualitative interviews with participants found that client motivations for ePEP/ ePrEP initiation 
and PrEP continuation included privacy, quick delivery, flexible delivery locations and times 
(e.g., weekend deliveries), and reduced stigma by health  care providers, family, and peers. 
Additionally, clients reported that ePEP/ePrEP delivery was easy to navigate —booking for 
clinical consultation was “just one click away” —and that multiple communication channels 
allowed  easy access to health  care providers. Reaso ns for online PrEP discontinuation included 
financial constraints (associated with delivery fees), low HIV risk perception, relocation outside 
Kenya , and inability to find a private delivery location.  
• The estimated cost for an online PrEP client 13,107 KES (US$101.70)  was higher  than for an 
online  PEP client 11,08 4 KES  (US$86.00). If ePrEP and e PEP were scaled  to an annual  client 
volume of 2,500, the financial costs would be 9,924  KES (US $77.00) per PrEP client and 8,893  
KES (US$69.00) per PEP client. The largest  financial cost drivers  for this approach (as far as 
percentage of total cost) are courier delivery of HIV test kits and drugs (PrEP  at 49.0%; PEP  at 
40.0%), demand generation (PrEP  at 21.6%; PEP  at 25.6%), and equipment, system 
development, and utilities (PrEP  at 16.7%; PEP  at 19.8%).  
Commodity QA and quality checks were critical  
• QA and quality checks for PEP and PrEP commodities w ere critical to ensuring that commodities 
were stored in a manner aligned with MOH standards.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 26  Programmatic and research r ecommendations  
The following recommendations are based on key learnings from the pilot  for online pharmacy PrEP 
and PEP service delivery in Kenya. Stakeholders should consider these as they move forward with 
introducing, expanding, and/or sustaining the ePrEP /ePEP  model . 
Recommendations for MOHs  and their technical assistance partners  
Establish an enabling policy framework  
Having a supportive legal and policy structure that enables the establishment of online pharmacies is 
critical for implementing an effective and sustainable ePrEP/ePEP model. This includes having 
policymakers adjust country HIV treatment and prevention guidelines to list ePrEP /ePEP  as a 
recommended  delivery model and collaborating with country regulatory entities to establish the 
regulatory framework and guidelines for operating online pharmacy –based health service delivery. 
Policymakers  should consider oth er revisions  to guidelines, as well,  to simplify PrEP and PEP access , 
including considerations to  mitigate barriers hampering  transition between PrEP and PEP (e.g., 
enabling provision of a one -month starter supply of PrEP for anyone enrolling on PEP  and/or 
providing free test kits to PEP clients who want to transition to PrEP) .23  
Conduct formative work to tailor  the model to population preferences  
Given the significant financial resources required to establish ePrEP /ePEP  services and ensure a 
financially viable model, it is essential to conduct formative research to obtain feedback from local 
government , online pharmacies , and the target population of potential ePrEP /ePEP  clients to align 
service provision with user preferences and increase feasibility and reach. The ePrEP /ePEP  study team 
spent a considerable amount of time designing a care pathway and assessing user preferences for 
services. The opt imal care pathway will likely vary by setting , so countries will need to conduct 
formative research in their local context s and should c onsider  inclusion of  additional PrEP products 
and other related health products in the ePrEP /ePEP  platforms to expand product choice, especially as 
new PrEP products become available  in-country  (e.g., event -driven PrEP, PrEP vaginal rings, injectable 
PrEP products ). Stakeholders should also ensure that client satisfaction surveys and other client 
feedback mechanisms are integrated into ePrEP /ePEP  models to ensure services align with client 
needs and expectations; ensuring client satisfaction is a key factor for retaining and growing an 
ePrEP /ePEP  customer base.  
Consider i ntegrat ing AI-assisted diagnostics  
The integration of an AI -facilitated result interpretation system for HIVST in Kenya’s ePrEP /ePEP  pilot 
may have enhance d QA and quality control of HIV test results , although this has not been evaluated . 
For online pharmacy models that include HIVST as an option, implementers could  consider integrating 
an AI component to make HIV test results easier for telehealth providers to interpret . 
Recommendations for online pharmacies  
Start with an implementation roadmap  
Appendix 2 provides a checklist of key topics that stakeholders should consider (including as part of 
co-creation sessions) while planning introduc tion of  an ePrEP /ePEP  model. Responses to these 
questions could then inform the development of a customized ePrEP /ePEP  roadmap that partners 
could use during the ePrEP /ePEP  setup  phase.  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 27  Secure seed investments for ePrEP /ePEP  platform development and demand generation  
Establishing an online pharmacy model necessitates significant upfront investment. Key areas for seed 
investment include establishing the online pharmacy platform (if it is not yet established) and 
supporting demand generation to drive awareness and uptake  to establish a robust client base for 
ePrEP /ePEP . Partners and online pharmacy chains need to adequately budget for demand generation, 
including formative assessments to tailor campaigns to audience segments, campaign materials 
development, and strategies  to continuously refresh campaign content for ongoing engagement 
among potential and existing ePrEP /ePEP  clients. If the model will include AI -assisted diagnostics, this 
will require an upfront investment , as well as ongoing costs. Given the resources necessary to initiate 
such a model and the minimal profit potential for ePrEP /ePEP  services in low - and middle -income 
countries without insurance coverage for these services, digital health companies may need support 
from country governments and/or donors to o ffset upfront costs to set up such a model.  
Adjust pricing based on evolving market conditions  
Pricing is a delicate balance between remaining competitive in the market and ensuring profitability. 
Online pharmacies will need to adapt pricing based on evolving market conditions, as the digital 
health company  did when the price for procurement of HIV STs dramatically increased midway through 
the pilot.  
Secure a financially sustainable supply of commodities  
For both phases of the ePrEP /ePEP  pilot in Kenya, the subcounty governments of the two pilot 
counties (Nairobi and Mombasa ) donated PrEP and PEP commodities to ensure that ePrEP /ePEP  
services were affordable for potential clients. Outside of the pilot, the same digital health company  
sold a one -month supply of brand name PrEP for 7,740 KES ( US$59.00) to clients with a prescription. If 
this PrEP cost were to be added to the phase 2 model, the cost to the client to access one  month of 
PrEP would increase six to nine  times (depending on which HIV test is used). If subcounty 
governments are able to continue donating PrEP and PEP supplies to online pharmacy chains during 
early market growth, this would help to ensure services are affordable and accessible to potential 
clients. Alternatively, online pharmacie s could offer generic PrEP and PEP at prices much lower than 
those of the innovator brands. Adding the cost of PrEP and PEP  would likely reduce the market size for 
initial uptake and discourage PEP -to-PrEP tran sition and PrEP continuation, but it would enhance 
sustainability of the model. For each component of the ePrEP /ePEP  model (e.g., HIV test kits, PrEP, 
PEP, deliveries, consultation fees), willingness -to-pay research and experimentation with different price 
points are important to inform pricing that makes “business sense” while enabling a wide range of 
clients to access  needed HIV prevention services.  
Expand online pharmacy services to enhance sustainability  
Private online healthcare businesses should position and market ePrEP /ePEP  as part of the ir platforms ’ 
broader telehealth capability , which would help to broaden the client base beyond those interested in 
HIV prevention services and diversify revenue streams, including by bringing in repeat customers not 
only for HIV prevention products but also for other health  care needs across the board. To enhance 
commercial viability of the ePrEP /ePEP  model , online pharmacies  need to target clients beyond 
ePrEP /ePEP  services  by considering other products clients may need that could be offered to them 
during consultation appointments and/or as part of a bundled package for various client types/needs 
(e.g., bundling PrEP and family planning services and products). This could co ntribute to and ensure 
an increase in revenue streams.

Appendix 1. HIV prevention context in Kenya  
While Kenya has made great progress in reducing HIV incidence, additional efforts are needed to 
expand access and availability of HIV prevention services. The Division of National AIDS and STI 
Control Program has adopted a precision combination prevention approach that calls for access to 
multiple prevention options at facility and non -facility outlets. Building on the promise of physical 
pharmacies as a differentiated pre- and post -exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP/PEP ) delivery channel and 
telehealth as an emerg ing health care platform in Kenya, online pharmacies have the potential to offer 
an additional option for clients seeking private and convenient access to biomedical HIV prevention.  
HIV epidemic in Kenya  
Kenya has made significant strides in tackling its HIV epidemic, recording a 68.4% decline in new HIV 
infections  between 201 3 and 202 1.24 Despite this progress, Kenya ranks among countries with the 
largest HIV epidemics, with an estimated 1.4 million people living with HIV and 26,000 people newly 
diagnosed with HIV in 2022.25,26 Mombasa  and Nairobi (both 100 % urban ) are among eight high -
burden counties that account for more than half of all new HIV infections reported in Kenya.24,26  
PrEP and PEP use in Kenya  
Kenya was the second African country to issue regulatory approval for oral PrEP,24 which was 
introduced in 2016 . Additionally,  non-occupational PEP has been approved for survivors of sexual 
assault or violence and those who experience high vulnerability to HIV.27 However, studies indicate 
low knowledge and use of PEP among sex workers, despite high interest , especially as an alternative 
to long -term PrEP use.28 Per Kenya's 2017 PrEP implementation framework, the country aimed to 
provide PrEP to 500,000 Kenyans with substantial ongoing risk for HIV infection by 2022;29 as of 
quarter  4 (Q4) 2023, the country had 438,003 cumulative PrEP initiations.30 
Existing PrEP and PEP service delivery platforms in Kenya  
As in other sub -Saharan African countries, PrEP and PEP services in Kenya are primarily delivered 
through public -sector clinics,31 specifically HIV clinics, antenatal clinics, and key population or 
adolescent drop -in centers.32 Building on the 2017 Framework for the Implementation of Pre -exposure 
Prophylaxis of HIV in Kenya  recommendation for additional delivery channels to more effectively roll 
out PrEP among priority populations,29 there have been focused efforts to integrate PrEP into 
community platforms  such as  safe spaces and digitally -facilitated and home -based dispensing 
through the United States  President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ’s (PEPFAR ) Determined, Resilient, 
Empowered, AIDS -free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) initiative  (see “Community platforms” 
subsection below) . Brick -and-mortar and online pharmacy -based PrEP delivery has the potential to 
increase access and contribute to financial sustainability of the HIV response.  
Public -sector HIV care 
As in other sub -Saharan African countries, PrEP and PEP services in Kenya are delivered  primarily  
through public -sector HIV care clinics,31 with PrEP offered at HIV clinics, antenatal clinics, and key 
population or adolescent drop -in centers.32 The number of health facilities offering PrEP has grown 
from 107 in 2017 to almost 2,000 in 2020 ,24,33 with more than 438,000 cumulative PrEP initiations as of 
December 2023.34 Kenya’s 2022 PEPFAR Country Operational Plan highlighted gaps , including low 
PrEP uptake and high PrEP discontinuation rates, citing the concentration of PrEP services at public -
sector HIV clinics, health worker attitudes and knowledge gaps, and stigma attached to HIV as 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 29  barriers.35 Additional studies have found that low uptake and poor outcomes associated with public 
facility –based PrEP delivery are driven by barriers at both the client  level (lack of privacy, fear of HIV-
related stigma, transportation  issues , and long wait times , including cost of lost income for missing 
work) and provider  level (competing priorities, clinic overcrowding, and lack of PrEP and PEP 
knowledge ).27 Even in settings where PrEP uptake and persistence are high, objective adherence 
measures indicate that actual adherence to daily oral PrEP among enrolled clients may be far lower 
than the self-reported numbers.36  
Providers at public -sector HIV clinics in Kenya have adapted practices to address barriers limiting PrEP 
uptake and effective use. For example, providers at 25 high -volume public HIV care clinics in western 
and central Kenya involved in the  University of Washington’s Partners Scale -Up Project  (2017 –2020) 
noted initiating clients on PrEP without creatinine testing (if the client was otherwise healthy), issuing 
two to three  months of PrEP supply (instead of the recommended one-month supply), “fast -tracking” 
PrEP clients, dispensing PrEP in clinic consultation rooms (instead of clinic pharmacies), and 
incorporating PrEP -related topics into routine health talks. All of these practices have led to higher 
PrEP initiation and above -average continuation at clinics adopting a mix of these practices.37  
Integration with public -sector family planning  and antenatal care  services  
Demonstration projects integrating PrEP into family planning and maternal and child health clinics in 
Kenya revealed that only 20 % of women screened and counseled on PrEP initiated PrEP, with only 50 % 
who initiated returning for at least one refill visit. More recent analysis of PrEP use outside of a 
demonstration study during Kenya’s early PrEP roll -out phase showed overall uptake to be even lower, 
at 7%, with PrEP persistence declining by more than half at six -month follow -up visits.32  
While integrating PrEP and PEP into existing HIV testing and counseling services at public -sector 
clinics was advantageous, the 2017 Kenya PrEP implementation framework noted a need for 
additional delivery channels for more effective PrEP rollout among priority populations.29 And despite 
recent efforts to optimize delivery and availability of PrEP through public -sector channels, new and 
differentiated delivery models are needed to overcome barriers and provide current and potential new 
PrEP clients with options that fit their preferences. The Frontline AIDS  Kenya : HIV Prevention Shadow 
Report 2020  also calls for the need for more differentiated and contextualized approaches to PrEP 
provision.33 
Community platforms  
There have been focused efforts to integrate PrEP into community platforms in Kenya, including 
through safe spaces  and through digitally  facilitated and home -based dispensing through the US 
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative for adolescent girls and young women 
(AGYW) called DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS -free, Mentored, and Safe) , with a 
goal of  address ing concerns related to stigma, privacy, and service convenience  for AGYW .38 Through 
the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) trial in rural Kenya and Uganda, 
same -day PrEP initiation was offered to individuals testing HIV negative as part of integrated 
community testing for HIV, hypertension, diabetes, an d malaria, with a flexible system for refill access 
at either a health  facilit y or a communit y-based site .39 In selected  SEARCH trial communities, a multi -
component intervention to expand PEP through enhanced community mobilization using community 
leaders, a PEP mobile phone hotline, and community -based medication delivery proved to be feasible 
and facilitated high PEP adhe rence and completion.40 
Brick -and-mortar pharmacies (pilot studies)  
Pharmacy -based PrEP delivery holds promise for increasing PrEP access and decentralization, reaching 
individuals not accessing PrEP through facility and community models, with the added benefit of 

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 30  being a self -sustaining delivery model.41 Results from the Pharm PrEP pilot in western and central 
Kenya showed that private pharmacy –delivered PrEP was highly acceptable to clients, with strong 
willingness to pay; resulted in PrEP initiation and continuation outcomes comparable or higher to 
outcomes at public facility -delivered PrEP; and was successful in reaching populations not typically 
reached through facility -based PrEP services, notably older men.42 Private pharmacy –delivered PEP 
also was evaluated through a six -month extension to the Pharm PrEP pilot. Results indicated high 
acceptability , and most clients and providers reported ease and a preference for pharmacy -delivered 
PrEP and PEP.43 A cluster randomized control trial evaluating this model’s effectiveness is ongoing. 
These studies will provide evidence to inform national policy shifts to allow private pharmacies to 
deliver PrEP and PEP services.  
Potential for online pharmacies to expand HIV prevention access  in Kenya  
Despite recent efforts to decentralize PrEP to other entry points, additional differentiated delivery 
models are needed to overcome continued barriers and provide current and potential new PrEP 
clients with options that suit their preferences. The HIV Prevention Shadow Report  2020  for Kenya also 
calls for the need for more contextualized approaches to PrEP provision.33 As mentioned  previously , 
adding an ePrEP/ePEP  option  to brick -and-mortar pharmacy services  has the potential to increase 
access and contribute to financial sustainability of the HIV response.  
Spurred by COVID -19, online pharmacies have been gaining presence in Kenya, with the digital health 
company that participated in the pilot  being the first to be licensed, leading to 17  online pharmacies 
providing direct -to-consumer health products by February 2022.44 A recent landscaping of online 
pharmacy regulations in Africa noted Kenya as particularly primed to integrate HIV services into online 
pharmacy platforms relative to other African countries, given its high mobile penetration , network of 
20 online pharmacies , existing underlying pharmacy and e -health policy framework s, and online 
pharmacy regulations that allow pharmacists or pharmaceutical technologists (pharm techs) to 
dispense over -the-counter or prescription health care products online.45  
  

 
 
 
 
 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 31  Appendix 2. Implementation roadmap  for ePrEP /ePEP  
The following is a checklist of key topics and questions that stakeholders should consider when 
planning to introduce the ePrEP/ePEP model . 
• Stakeholder engagement and advocacy for policy change : An enabling policy environment 
is critical for the ePrEP/ePEP model to be viable. Assess what is required for telehealth and 
online pharmacy licensure. In most policy contexts, it will be necessary to collaborate with 
regulators to secure approval or a research exemption to use telehealth for PrEP and PEP 
prescriptions. If  the model includes initiation of PrEP/PEP based on an HIV self -test (HIVST), 
the online pharmacy may need to seek approval or an exe mption to enable this , as well. 
Review policy guidance on who is allowed to conduct rapid diagnostic test s (RDTs) and 
dispense PrEP/PEP to ensure that your model complies with these and other requirements or 
has an exemption.  
• Service delivery model : Establish a client journey that maximizes privacy, convenience, and 
speed while minimizing cost (e.g., provider time, fuel for deliveries). Engage potential end  
users in co -designing the model with you to ensure that it aligns with their preferences and 
realities (e.g., how they want to learn about and access telehealth consultations, where and 
when they would want to receive delivery of HIV test s and PrEP or PEP, what type of follow -up 
communication is safe and acceptable to them ). 
• Sourcing and pricing of commodities : Identify a source of HIV tests and HIV prevention 
commodities, and then set consumer prices that balance affordability with financial 
sustainability. In some cases, the public supply authority may be willing to donate HIV tests 
and/or PrEP/PEP, particularly for implementation research, if the online pharmacy agrees to 
report service delivery and commodity consumption data to the public sector. If the source of 
supply is private distributors, confirm whether  prices to pha rmacies are open to market forces, 
subsidized, or controlled. Explore whether it is possible to accept public or private health 
insurance and what accreditation process may be required by insurance providers.  
• Provider training : Train telehealth providers and the delivery riders who will engage with 
clients in person. Confirm their proficiency in HIV testing, PrEP/PEP prescription, follow -up, 
adherence counseling, and anything else  relevant to their role and your model.  
• Quality assurance : Establish systems for supportive supervision of telehealth providers and 
riders, quality controls for commodities, post -market surveillance, etc. As a quality 
enhancement, consider integrating AI interpretation of HIV tests to support telehealth 
providers in their interpretation of test results and enable more effective supervision of 
telehealth providers. Ensure that any i ntegration of AI is aligned with policy guidance.  
• Linkages to care : Review guidelines for how to handle positive test results in your country 
context. Establish protocols to ensure HIV -positive clients are linked to care.  
• Demand generation : Raise awareness of service availability via a market campaign targeted 
toward likely users.  
• Monitoring and continuous improvement : Establish a monitoring plan with key 
performance indicators that include measures of quality , as well as uptake. Conduct routine 
data quality audits. Schedule routine “pause and reflect” meetings to review monitoring data 
and determine how to improve the model.

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 33  Appendix 4. One -step delivery journey details  
Details of the client journey using  one-step delivery  are as follows:  
1. The client book s a PrEP/PEP consultation , which 
includes registering for an online pharmacy 
account, signing the website consent form, 
completing a pre -call Rapid Assessment 
Screening Tool ( RAST) and then selecting a 
preferred time to be called by a clinic al officer 
(CO).  
2. The client’s  information  (name, age, and risk 
score according to the RAST , if completed ) is 
made available to the CO before  the 
consultation begins .  
3. The CO initiates the consultation  with an 
introduction, followed by RAST follow -up 
questioning and then an assess ment of  
eligibility for PrEP /PEP. This process is repeated 
during every scheduled follow -up for clinical 
reviews.  
4. Once the client confirms residency  in either  
Nairobi or Mombasa  County , the CO initiates 
an SMS prompt that sends the consent form 
for the client to sign. The client may choose to 
end the c onsultation call at this point to allow time to read through the consent form or choose to 
read through  it while still on the call with the CO. Once the client signs the consent form, the CO 
then proceeds to write a prescription for the HIVST  and PrEP  or PEP.  
5. The client orders  both the test and the PrEP  or PEP at the same time , and this bundled package is 
delivered specifically by a pharm tech rider.  
6. Upon arrival at the client’s location  of choice , the pharm tech dispenses the HIVST  or RDT , and  the 
client takes the test or the pharm tech administers the test, respectively. In cases of faulty self -
testing or phobia of self -testing, the CO alerts the pharm tech rider, who can assist the client with 
the test, if needed.  
7. Once the test results are ready, the client uploads a photo of the results for the CO’s review, and 
the pharm tech notifies the CO that the test is done.  
8. The CO then initiates a follow -up call with the client , during which the test result is verified. If the 
test result is negative , the CO gives the go -ahead to the pharm tech rider to dispense the 
PrEP/PEP being held for the client.  If the test result is positive, the CO provides counseling and 
referral to a facility for the client to undergo a repeat HIV test, in accordance with the national 
testing guidelines.  
9. During a PEP client ’s 28-day follow -up call, the  client is  advised on transitioning to PrEP use upon 
completion of PEP.  
10. PrEP clients are advised to adhere to medicine refill s, follow -up consultations , and HIV testing (at 
enrollment, a fter one month, and thereafter every three  months) , as per the 2022  Kenya HIV 
Prevention and Treatment G uideline s. (In this model, clients pay for these HIV tests.)  Figure 5. Rapid Assessment Screening Tool

 Online pharmacy PrEP and PEP: Technical considerations and learnings from Kenya     Page 35  Appendix  5. Telehealth licensure journey  in Kenya  
The digital health company  went through a licensure process to register  a physical clinic and obtain 
permission for their telehealth service. The following steps describe that journey  in Kenya (the process 
may look different in other countries ): 
1. The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council ( KMPDC) advised the digital health company 
to set up a physical clinic before being issued with a telehealth license.  
2. The digital health company  applied  to Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) to become a licensed 
level 2 facility.  
3. The digital health company  established a  physical clinic according to NMS and Ministry of Health 
requirements and submitted an application for inspection.  
4. The NMS conducted an initial inspection of the facility and provided feedback. After feedback was 
addressed and a second inspection  was completed , the facility was certified.  
5. The digital health company  submitted an application to the KMPDC for level 2 facility registration. 
All documents were verified by a lawyer  and then signed and completed by a medical officer.  
6. The KMPDC approved the application and issued a license  to the online pharmacy . 
7. Once the level 2 license was received, (a) the digital health company applied to the subcounty 
government for Master  Facility  List inclusion and code assignment , which was granted upon 
inspection ; and (b) the digital health company was eligible to apply for a telehealth license.  
8. To register as a telehealth facility, a KMPDC registration number of someone employed at the 
facility is needed ; hence , the digital health company hired a medical officer to meet this 
requirement.  
9. Once these steps were completed,  the digital health company  was issued a telehealth license and 
approved to launch services.
