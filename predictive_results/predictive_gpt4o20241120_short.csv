0,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), holds transformative potential for HIV prevention by enhancing the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. Traditional approaches to targeting HIV prevention efforts often rely on known risk groups (e.g., young women, serodiscordant couples), which may miss less-recognized subpopulations or fail to efficiently allocate resources. Machine learning, utilizing tools like the Super Learner algorithm, offers a more adaptive and data-driven approach.

By analyzing population-level data, including demographic and behavioral factors, ML can construct risk scores that predict HIV seroconversion with greater accuracy and efficiency. For example, in rural Kenya and Uganda, ML-based risk scores identified high-risk individuals with fewer false positives compared to both risk-group and model-based approaches. To achieve 50% sensitivity for identifying seroconversions, ML targeted only 18% of the population, compared to 27% and 42% for model-based and risk-group strategies, respectively. This enhanced efficiency reduces the number of people needing targeted interventions, optimizing resource allocation.

ML also enables flexible, scalable integration into HIV prevention programs, such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) distribution. By identifying individuals who may not belong to traditional risk groups but still face significant risk, AI-driven tools can expand the reach of prevention efforts while minimizing missed cases. As testing and treatment access grow, AI offers a dynamic, cost-effective solution to refine and scale HIV prevention strategies, particularly in resource-limited, high-prevalence regions."
1,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize HIV prevention by identifying individuals at highest risk for HIV acquisition with unprecedented precision and efficiency. In a study using data from rural Kenya and Uganda, machine learning algorithms, particularly the Super Learner ensemble method, were employed to predict one-year HIV seroconversion risk. AI outperformed traditional approaches, such as relying on known risk groups or model-based scores, in both sensitivity (correctly identifying seroconversions) and efficiency (targeting fewer individuals for prevention).

By leveraging complex patterns in demographic and behavioral data, machine learning algorithms can identify individuals at risk who might be overlooked by conventional methods, such as those not fitting predefined risk categories (e.g., serodiscordant couples, young women). For example, to achieve a fixed 50% sensitivity, machine learning targeted only 18% of the population, compared to 27% with model-based methods and 42% with risk-group strategies, thereby streamlining resource allocation for interventions like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

AI also demonstrated flexibility in adapting to regional and demographic variations, enabling customized prevention strategies. The integration of AI-driven risk scoring into community-based HIV testing programs has already shown feasibility, providing real-time identification of high-risk individuals eligible for PrEP.

By enhancing the accuracy of risk predictions while minimizing the resources required, AI offers a transformative approach to HIV prevention, especially in resource-limited, high-prevalence settings.
