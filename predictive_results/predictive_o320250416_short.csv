0,NO,"Artificial-intelligence tools can transform HIV prevention by turning routinely-collected data into highly discriminative, real-time risk scores. In rural Kenya and Uganda, Balzer et al. applied the Super Learner ensemble to >160 000 person-years of population-based testing data. Using only demographic and household variables, the algorithm identified imminent (1-year) seroconversions far better than conventional approaches:

• Efficiency: To capture 50 % of future infections, machine learning had to flag only 18 % of residents, vs 27 % for stepwise logistic models and 42 % when targeting traditional “risk groups”.  
• Reach: When the number targeted was capped at 45 % of the population, AI detected 78 % of seroconversions—20 percentage points more than guideline-based screening.  
• Equity: Gains were observed across women, men, youth and older adults, suggesting broader, less biased coverage than rules anchored to single behaviours (e.g., serodiscordant partnership).

Such AI-derived scores can be embedded in community testing campaigns, mobile apps or electronic health records to triage who is offered pre-exposure prophylaxis, partner services, or intensified testing, maximising impact while containing costs. As epidemics evolve, algorithms can be re-trained on fresh data, ensuring prevention resources remain precisely targeted where new infections are most likely to occur."
1,NO,"Artificial-intelligence tools—specifically ensemble machine-learning algorithms such as Super Learner—can transform HIV prevention by turning routinely collected, low-cost data into highly accurate risk maps. In a population of 75 558 adults tested annually in rural Kenya and Uganda, a Super Learner model that blended penalised regression, additive models and other learners predicted one-year seroconversion far better than either simple “risk-group” rules or traditional logistic-regression scores. For a fixed 50 % sensitivity, the AI model needed to flag only 18 % of the population compared with 27 % for regression and 42 % for demographic risk-groups, cutting the “number-needed-to-target” by up to 2.4-fold. Conversely, when the proportion offered intensified prevention (e.g., PrEP, partner services) was capped at 45 %, AI captured 78 % of impending infections—20 % more than conventional rules. These gains held across sexes, age strata and three epidemiologically diverse regions.

Practically, AI can be embedded in community or clinic HIV testing platforms, electronic health records or mobile apps to generate real-time risk scores that guide counsellors to: 1) prioritise PrEP initiation, 2) schedule earlier retesting, 3) deploy partner notification teams, and 4) channel prevention budgets to communities with the highest predicted incidence. Because the algorithms learn from new data, they can adapt as local epidemics, behaviours and ART coverage change, offering a scalable, data-driven path toward maximising the impact and cost-effectiveness of limited prevention resources.

2,NO,"Artificial intelligence can turn routine health data into precise, actionable prevention. In the SEARCH population study (>75 000 adults, Kenya and Uganda), an ensemble-learning algorithm (Super Learner) was trained on easily collected variables—age, sex, marital status, occupation, alcohol use, mobility and household factors—to predict each person’s one-year risk of HIV seroconversion. The model learned complex, non-linear patterns missed by classic logistic regression or simple “risk-group” rules.

Results show the preventive power of AI:  
• To capture 50 % of future infections, machine learning needed to flag only 18 % of the population versus 27 % with regression and 42 % with conventional risk groups—a two- to three-fold gain in efficiency.  
• When the proportion targeted was capped at 45 %, the algorithm identified 78 % of new infections, 20 percentage-points better than risk-group approaches.  
• Gains held across regions, sexes and age bands, and the model can be updated continuously as epidemics evolve.

Deployed on tablets or within electronic medical records, such algorithms can generate an instant “HIV-risk score” during community testing or clinic visits, guiding counsellors to offer pre-exposure prophylaxis, self-tests or partner services to those most likely to benefit. By shrinking the number-needed-to-treat and expanding coverage of true high-risk individuals, AI allows programmes to stretch limited prevention budgets while accelerating progress toward epidemic control."
3,NO,"Artificial-intelligence tools can transform HIV prevention from blunt, group-based approaches to precise, data-driven targeting.  In the SEARCH trial in rural Kenya and Uganda, an ensemble machine-learning model (Super Learner) was trained on routine census and annual testing data—age, sex, marital status, occupation, alcohol use, mobility, household HIV history, etc.—to predict an individual’s one-year risk of seroconversion.

Compared with conventional methods, AI markedly sharpened who to reach with prevention:

• Efficiency: To find half of future infections, the machine-learning score had to flag only 18 % of residents, versus 27 % with step-wise regression and 42 % when simply targeting “known risk groups” (young women, serodiscordant couples, fishermen, bar or transport workers).  
• Sensitivity: When the proportion targeted was capped at 45 %, AI captured 78 % of incident cases, 20 percentage points more than the risk-group strategy.  
• Equity: The algorithm uncovered high-risk men and older adults often overlooked by traditional criteria, while cut-off tuning can guarantee minimum coverage of key populations such as youth.  

The score runs on easily collected variables, so it can be embedded in community HIV testing campaigns, mobile applications, or electronic health records.  In SEARCH, a point-of-care version screened 69 121 HIV-negative persons and immediately referred 7 256 for PrEP—demonstrating real-world feasibility.

By continuously learning from incoming data, AI systems can anticipate where new infections will occur, prioritise PrEP, self-testing kits, or male circumcision to those most likely to benefit, and iteratively adapt as the epidemic and prevention toolbox evolve."
4,NO,"Artificial intelligence can turn routine demographic data into pragmatic “risk maps” that guide who, where and when to intensify HIV prevention. In rural Kenya and Uganda, an ensemble-learning method (Super Learner) analysed age, sex, marital status, mobility, occupation, alcohol use and household HIV information from >75 000 residents tested annually. The algorithm learned complex, non-linear patterns that standard risk-group lists or stepwise regression missed. As a result:

•  To capture half of all incident infections, machine learning had to focus on only 18 % of the population, vs 27 % with conventional modelling and 42 % with simple risk-group criteria – a two- to three-fold gain in efficiency.

•  When resources allowed outreach to 45 % of people, the algorithm correctly identified 78 % of future seroconversions, 20 percentage-points higher than the risk-group approach and 10 points higher than regression.

Such gains translate directly into more focused HIV testing, partner notification, PrEP, or condom campaigns, saving scarce funds while minimising overtreatment. Because the model relies on easily collected variables (no sexual-behaviour reporting or laboratory data), it can be embedded in electronic medical records, community health-worker tablets or mobile apps and updated continuously as new data accumulate. Field-testing in the SEARCH trial already demonstrated real-time use: 69 121 HIV-negative adults were screened and 7 256 prioritised for PrEP during community campaigns.

In short, AI enables adaptive, data-driven prevention—zooming resources onto the individuals and locales where the next infections are most likely to occur and helping realise the promise of precision public health for HIV."
