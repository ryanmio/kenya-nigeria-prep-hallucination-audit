- Enabling more precise risk stratification through analysis of diverse, real-time data (e.g., EMR, behavioral patterns, community risk factors), leading to better identification of individuals most vulnerable to HIV acquisition and more strategic PrEP targeting.

- Predicting adherence risks and potential disengagement from care, allowing tailored, timely interventions to improve retention and outcomes in prevention services.

- Optimizing resource allocation and supply chain management by forecasting medication demand and geographic hotspots, thereby reducing stockouts and enhancing program efficiency.

- Supporting differentiated service delivery models by analyzing behavioral patterns and user preferences to personalize HIV prevention interventions, making services more accessible and responsive.

- Automating routine tasks such as initial risk assessments and appointment scheduling for frontline health workers, increasing workforce efficiency and enabling focus on complex care aspects amid staff shortages."
19,NO,"Predictive models can enhance HIV prevention programs by:

- Improving risk stratification through AI-driven analysis of rich, community-informed, real-time data to identify individuals most vulnerable to HIV acquisition, enabling more strategic and targeted PrEP offering.

- Predicting adherence risks and identifying individuals at risk of disengagement from care, allowing tailored interventions that improve retention and health outcomes.

- Optimizing resource allocation and program management by forecasting medication demand, identifying geographic hotspots, and enabling data-informed decision-making to maximize impact with limited funding.

- Supporting differentiated service delivery models by automating routine tasks (e.g., risk assessments, appointment scheduling) to alleviate health workforce shortages, thereby expanding service coverage and efficiency.

- Facilitating stigma-free education and remote access through AI chatbots and virtual counselors, providing personalized support for PrEP adherence and side effect management, especially for marginalized or hard-to-reach populations."
