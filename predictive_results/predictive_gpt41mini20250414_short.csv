0,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, offers a transformative approach to HIV prevention by improving the identification of individuals at high risk of acquiring HIV. A large population-based study in rural Kenya and Uganda applied machine learning algorithms, such as the Super Learner ensemble method, to demographic and behavioral data collected during community-wide HIV testing. This method was compared to traditional risk-group strategies (e.g., known high-risk groups like young women or serodiscordant couples) and model-based logistic regression risk scores.

Machine learning significantly outperformed conventional approaches in both sensitivity and efficiency. For example, to identify 50% of future HIV seroconversions, machine learning targeted only 18% of the population, compared with 27% for model-based and 42% for risk-group approaches, enabling more focused resource allocation. Similarly, when targeting the same proportion of individuals (up to 45%), machine learning achieved 78% sensitivity in identifying seroconversions, versus 68% and 58% for model-based and risk-group methods, respectively. These improvements were consistent across sex, age groups, and geographic regions.

By leveraging complex patterns in demographic data, machine learning can detect less obvious high-risk individuals who might be missed by traditional criteria, enhancing the precision of prevention efforts such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery. Importantly, this data-driven strategy is feasible in resource-limited, generalized epidemic settings and can adapt as epidemics evolve.

Integrating AI-driven risk prediction into HIV prevention programs could optimize the use of limited prevention resources, increase coverage of high-risk populations, and ultimately reduce new infections. Multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential to implement, evaluate, and update these AI tools to maximize their public health impact."
1,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, offers transformative potential in HIV prevention by enabling more precise identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. A large population-based study in rural Kenya and Uganda applied machine learning algorithms to demographic and behavioral data from over 75,000 individuals tested annually for HIV. Using the Super Learner ensemble method, researchers developed an HIV risk score that outperformed traditional approaches based on known risk groups (e.g., young women, serodiscordant couples) and model-based logistic regression risk scores.

The machine learning risk score demonstrated improved accuracy (AUC 0.73 vs. 0.59–0.70) in predicting 1-year HIV seroconversion. Importantly, it enhanced efficiency by requiring fewer individuals to be targeted for prevention interventions to achieve equivalent sensitivity. For example, to identify 50% of future HIV seroconversions, the machine learning approach targeted only 18% of the population compared to 42% with the risk group strategy. At a fixed maximum target of 45% of the population, machine learning identified 78% of seroconversions, compared to 58% and 68% with risk group and model-based methods, respectively.

These improvements translate to more efficient allocation of prevention resources, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), by focusing on those most likely to benefit. The approach leverages routinely collected demographic data, circumventing the need for detailed sexual behavior measures, which can be underreported or unavailable. Early implementation in community-wide HIV testing demonstrated feasibility, with machine learning guiding referrals for PrEP.

In summary, AI-driven risk stratification can refine HIV prevention strategies by enhancing risk prediction accuracy and targeting efficiency, ultimately improving epidemic control in generalized HIV epidemic settings. Multidisciplinary efforts are essential to integrate, evaluate, and update AI tools within HIV prevention programs."
2,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning, offers transformative potential in HIV prevention by enhancing the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. A large-scale study in rural Kenya and Uganda applied machine learning algorithms, notably the Super Learner ensemble method, to demographic and behavioral data collected through population-level HIV testing. This approach outperformed traditional strategies—including targeting known risk groups (e.g., young women, partners of people living with HIV) and model-based logistic regression risk scores—in both sensitivity and efficiency.

Machine learning achieved a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 0.73 vs. 0.70 and 0.59), indicating better discrimination of individuals who would seroconvert. For a fixed sensitivity of 50%, it targeted only 18% of the population, compared to 27% and 42% by model-based and risk group approaches, respectively. Conversely, when fixing the proportion targeted to 45%, machine learning identified 78% of seroconversions, outperforming 68% and 58% by the other methods. This translates into fewer individuals needing intensive prevention interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), thus optimizing resource allocation.

Importantly, machine learning can capture complex, nonlinear relationships among multiple risk factors that traditional methods may miss, improving identification even where risk perception or self-reporting is unreliable. While demographic data were the primary inputs, incorporation of behavioral and clinical data could further enhance performance.

The successful deployment of machine learning-based risk scores in rural African settings demonstrates feasibility and acceptability, suggesting AI-driven tools can guide targeted prevention strategies, improve cost-effectiveness, and ultimately contribute to reducing new HIV infections in generalized epidemic contexts. Multidisciplinary efforts are needed to implement, refine, and scale these AI approaches within public health frameworks."
3,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, offers transformative potential for HIV prevention by enhancing the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, thereby optimizing targeted interventions like preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). A large population-based study in rural Kenya and Uganda applied machine learning algorithms (Super Learner ensemble method) to demographic and behavioral data from over 75,000 individuals with repeated HIV testing. Compared to traditional risk-group approaches (e.g., young women, serodiscordant couples) and standard model-based risk scores using logistic regression, machine learning significantly improved both efficiency and sensitivity in predicting 1-year HIV seroconversion risk.

Machine learning required targeting only 18% of the population to achieve 50% sensitivity in identifying future seroconversions, compared to 42% with risk-group strategies and 27% with model-based scores. When fixing the proportion targeted to 45%, machine learning identified 78% of seroconversions, surpassing 58% for risk groups and 68% for model-based strategies. These improvements translated into fewer individuals needing to receive intensified prevention per seroconversion identified, enhancing resource allocation efficiency.

Importantly, machine learning captured complex, non-linear relationships among diverse demographic factors without relying solely on known risk groups, reducing missed high-risk subpopulations. Although challenges remain in achieving optimal sensitivity among youth, machine learning models can be adjusted for age-specific risk thresholds. Preliminary implementation in community-based testing programs demonstrated feasibility for real-time risk scoring to guide PrEP referrals.

Overall, AI-driven risk prediction represents a promising tool to reimagine HIV prevention by enabling precise, data-driven prioritization of prevention resources in generalized epidemic settings, potentially accelerating progress toward epidemic control while ensuring equitable and efficient service delivery."
4,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), offers transformative potential for HIV prevention by enhancing the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, thus enabling more efficient and targeted prevention strategies. In a large population-based study in rural Kenya and Uganda involving >75,000 individuals and 166,000 person-years of follow-up, researchers compared three approaches for predicting one-year HIV seroconversion risk: traditional risk group membership, a model-based logistic regression risk score, and an ML risk score employing the Super Learner ensemble algorithm.

The ML approach outperformed the others, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 versus 0.70 for the model-based and 0.59 for the risk group strategy. Importantly, ML improved the efficiency and sensitivity of targeting prevention: to identify 50% of seroconversions, ML targeted only 18% of the population, compared to 27% and 42% for the model-based and risk group methods, respectively. When limiting the population targeted to 45%, ML correctly classified 78% of seroconversions, surpassing 68% and 58% for the model-based and risk group scores.

By leveraging diverse demographic data and flexible modeling without restrictive assumptions, ML can discover complex risk patterns beyond known risk groups, improving resource allocation for interventions such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This approach is feasible in generalized epidemic settings, as demonstrated by real-world implementation in community-wide HIV testing programs.

Integrating AI-driven risk prediction with existing clinical and behavioral data could optimize prevention delivery, reduce unnecessary targeting, and ultimately contribute to reducing new HIV infections. Multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to implement, evaluate, and refine these tools, ensuring ethical, acceptable, and sustainable integration into HIV prevention strategies worldwide."
5,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), offers transformative potential for HIV prevention by enabling precise identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. A major challenge in generalized epidemic settings, such as rural Kenya and Uganda, is efficiently prioritizing limited prevention resources like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to those most vulnerable.

Recent research utilizing over 75,000 individuals’ demographic and HIV testing data applied the Super Learner ensemble algorithm to develop a machine learning risk score predicting one-year HIV seroconversion risk. This approach outperformed traditional methods, including reliance on known risk groups (e.g., serodiscordant couples, young women) and standard regression-based risk scores. The ML model demonstrated higher sensitivity and greater efficiency: to identify 50% of future seroconversions, ML targeted only 18% of the population versus 42% and 27% for risk group and model-based strategies, respectively. At a fixed coverage of 45% of the population, ML captured 78% of seroconversions, substantially exceeding other approaches.

By integrating diverse demographic predictors without depending solely on self-reported behaviors or known risk groups, ML uncovers complex risk patterns, including less obvious subpopulations at elevated risk. This facilitates more cost-effective, targeted prevention, reducing the number needed to treat and optimizing resource allocation. Furthermore, implementation of ML risk scores at the point of community HIV testing has proven feasible in rural African settings.

In sum, AI-driven risk stratification represents a promising innovation to enhance HIV prevention. It can complement existing strategies by improving identification of individuals who would most benefit from intensified interventions, ultimately contributing to more effective epidemic control in resource-constrained settings."
6,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), offers transformative potential in HIV prevention by enhancing the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, thus enabling more efficient targeting of prevention resources. A large-scale study in rural Kenya and Uganda applied an ensemble ML approach, the Super Learner algorithm, to demographic and population-level HIV testing data to predict 1-year HIV seroconversion risk. This ML-based risk score outperformed traditional methods based on known risk groups (e.g., young women, serodiscordant couples) and model-based logistic regression risk scores.

Key findings demonstrated that ML improved both sensitivity and efficiency in identifying high-risk individuals. For example, to achieve a fixed sensitivity of 50% (correctly classifying half of future seroconversions), the ML approach targeted only 18% of the population, compared with 27% for the model-based score and 42% for the risk group strategy. At a fixed targeting rate of 45% of the population, ML identified 78% of seroconversions, outperforming the model-based (68%) and risk group (58%) approaches. Consequently, ML reduced the number needed to target per seroconversion by 1.3- to 2.4-fold relative to alternatives, optimizing resource allocation.

Moreover, ML risk scores based on readily available demographic data (age, sex, marital status, occupation, etc.) can be feasibly integrated into community-based testing programs, as demonstrated by the SEARCH study’s implementation in East Africa. This approach mitigates reliance on self-reported risk behaviors, which can be inaccurate, and may capture complex, non-linear risk patterns missed by traditional models.

In sum, AI-driven predictive modeling represents a promising avenue to reimagine HIV prevention by enabling precision targeting of intensive interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), thereby improving both the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of prevention efforts in generalized epidemic settings."

Importantly, these algorithms utilize demographic and household data without relying on self-reported sexual behavior, which can be underreported or inaccurately perceived, thus overcoming key limitations of traditional risk assessments. Machine learning also enables flexible integration of diverse data sources and adapts to evolving epidemics, potentially enhancing generalizability and targeting across populations.

Implementation of such AI-driven risk stratification tools into community and clinic-based HIV testing programs can optimize prevention delivery, ensuring that intensified interventions reach those most in need.

19,NO,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, offers transformative potential for HIV prevention by improving the identification of individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. In a large population-based study across 16 communities in rural Kenya and Uganda, machine learning models, specifically the Super Learner algorithm, were applied to demographic and behavioral data to predict 1-year HIV seroconversion risk more accurately than traditional approaches based on known risk groups or standard regression models.

Machine learning demonstrated superior performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 compared to 0.70 and 0.59 for model-based and risk group strategies, respectively. This enhanced predictive ability translated into greater efficiency: to achieve 50% sensitivity in identifying future HIV seroconversions, machine learning targeted only 18% of the population, significantly fewer than the 27% and 42% targeted by model-based and risk group approaches. At a fixed intervention coverage of 45% of the population, machine learning identified 78% of new seroconversions, outperforming the other methods by 10–20%. These efficiency gains imply that resources for intensive prevention, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), could be more precisely allocated, reducing unnecessary interventions while maximizing impact.

Importantly, machine learning incorporates complex, nonlinear relationships among diverse predictors and can adapt to population heterogeneity, capturing risk profiles beyond predefined categories. This data-driven targeting can enhance population-level HIV prevention strategies, especially in generalized epidemic settings with universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) access.

0,YES,"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential to enhance HIV prevention by addressing persistent gaps in service delivery, adherence, and risk stratification. Traditional risk assessment tools have struggled to keep pace with the epidemic’s dynamic nature; AI and machine learning can leverage rich, community-informed data to better identify individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition and tailor prevention services accordingly. AI-powered models integrated into electronic medical records (EMRs) enable real-time vulnerability prediction, improving targeting for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and retention.
