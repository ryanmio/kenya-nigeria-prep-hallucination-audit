Claim: PEPFAR “operates in 54 countries, primarily across Africa, delivering life-saving care to millions of people through a network of more than 19 000 full-time clinical and support staff.”

What the citation actually says: “According to PEPFAR’s Human Resources for Health data there are more than 190 000 full-time-equivalent clinical and ancillary care providers supported by the programme.”

The Lancet Comment therefore appears to understate the workforce by roughly a factor of ten. There is also a nuance about employment status. The amfAR brief describes these workers as “full-time equivalents” whose salaries or incentives are subsidised by PEPFAR; many are community or government employees rather than staff hired directly by the programme. The Comment, however, presents them as PEPFAR’s own full-time staff, which could be read as implying a much larger direct payroll than actually exists.

I might be missing something. The authors could have intended to quote a narrower subset of personnel—perhaps clinical staff only—or the missing zero might simply be a typographical error. Either explanation would be easy to clarify.

If left uncorrected, the figure risks minimising how disruptive a funding suspension could be. Under-reporting the size of the workforce may lessen the perceived urgency of maintaining continuous support for services such as HIV testing, treatment, and gender-based-violence care.
