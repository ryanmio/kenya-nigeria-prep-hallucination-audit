Claim: Strengthening US private-sector collaborations can also have a role to help drive innovation and boost service delivery efficiency, particularly to offer new digital health solutions.12

What the citation actually says: The referenced Salient Advisory market-intelligence report (July 2024) profiles ten African health-technology firms working on supply-chain tools, digital records, e-pharmacies and similar platforms for HIV, TB and malaria care. It documents examples from Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and other settings and notes that such partnerships remain under-utilised in Africa. The report does not mention the United States, does not discuss US private-sector collaborations, and does not frame its findings as guidance for US policy or programmes.

In other words, the source highlights African innovators and government partnerships, not US firms or collaborations. The Lancet Comment appears to graft a US-centric policy recommendation onto a citation that never touches on that subject.

It is possible the authors intended to cite a different document focused on US private-sector engagement, or to use the Salient report merely as an example of digital innovation potential. If so, the link between claim and citation would benefit from explicit explanation.

As written, the claim attributes policy relevance to a source that does not support it, potentially overstating the evidence for engaging US companies in digital health partnerships.
