Claim: Populations most affected by HIV, especially key populations such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, and LGBT communities, stand to lose the most as transitions occur and the human-rights environment in some countries deteriorates.13

What the citation actually says: The article "Accelerating and sustaining progress: PEPFAR's path to achieving 95-95-95 by 2030" (Ruffner et al., 2024) reviews PEPFAR's priorities for reaching UNAIDS targets. It notes that men who have sex with men and professional sex workers have higher HIV risk than the general population and that punitive laws can undermine efforts to reach them. It recommends that acceleration efforts go hand-in-hand with strategies that advance a human-rights approach. The article does not claim that key populations will "lose the most" as funding transitions take place, does not discuss programme transitions in terms of comparative harms across groups, and does not say that the human-rights environment is deteriorating; rather, it calls for supportive policies.

My reading is that the Lancet Comment links three separate ideas—programme transitions, deteriorating human-rights climates, and disproportionate harm to key populations—in a way that is not present in the cited source. I may have missed a passage, but after a full read I could not find language equating transitions with a unique risk of loss for key populations.

Attributing this stronger causal claim to Ruffner et al. overstates the evidence and could give readers the impression that published analyses have demonstrated such an effect when, in fact, no such evaluation is provided in the cited article.
