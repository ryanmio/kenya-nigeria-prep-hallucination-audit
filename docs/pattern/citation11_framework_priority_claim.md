Claim: One priority is the development of a framework to responsibly transition a majority of US-supported HIV programmes to country-led systems with progressive co-financing mechanisms, recognising each country context is unique.11

What the citation actually says: The same Viewpoint article by Kates, Honermann and Millett outlines recent fiscal and political pressures on PEPFAR and poses open questions about how and when transitions to domestic financing might occur. It mentions that other development institutions sometimes use co-financing thresholds tied to income levels and asks whether such strategies should be considered for PEPFAR. It does not call this a priority, does not state that a majority of programmes should transition, and does not describe a specific framework or timeline. The words “progressive co-financing mechanisms” do not appear in the article.

My reading is that the Lancet Comment again turns exploratory questions into prescriptive language. The Viewpoint simply raises the idea of co-financing as one option among many and emphasises that lessons from past transitions need to be examined. It does not instruct PEPFAR to develop a framework or identify this as an urgent priority.

I could have missed a sentence that more strongly supports the Comment's wording, but after reviewing the source I did not find it. Presenting an open question as an agreed priority risks implying consensus and urgency where the source authors offered caution and inquiry.
