# Undisclosed or Under-disclosed Audere Links  
Lancet HIV Comment – "Reimagining HIV prevention with artificial intelligence"  
Online first · June 11 2025  

Workshop‐derived publications are common in global health. When produced transparently, they enrich the literature. In this instance, however, transparency has fallen short. Several factors complicate the standard workshop-to-commentary pipeline, creating a misleading impression of independent scholarship:

1. Reused sponsor language: Multiple sentences in the Lancet Comment reproduce or closely paraphrase language originating in an Audere-sponsored white paper, yet attribute these statements to unrelated peer-reviewed studies.

2. Undisclosed intellectual contributions: Eight of the Comment’s ten authors—including lead author Jirair Ratevosian, who drafted the Audere white paper—are acknowledged contributors to the Audere-sponsored report that directly informed key language and recommendations presented. Under Lancet HIV policy and ICMJE guidelines, this constitutes a non-financial conflict of interest that must be disclosed.

3. Misleading COI disclosure: One of the lead authors holds an active Senior Advisor role with Audere (the sponsor of the white paper), yet only discloses receiving "consulting fees." Under the Lancet HIV’s published standards, all active organizational roles—financial or non-financial—must be disclosed due to their perceived influence.

These omissions create a false impression of independent analysis and unbiased evidence. According to Lancet’s correction policy, missing declarations of interest clearly warrant a formal correction.

In summary, the Lancet HIV Comment failed to transparently disclose key connections to Audere, including one author's active advisory role and multiple undisclosed intellectual contributions from seven authors. This clearly constitutes a significant disclosure gap under the journal’s own guidelines, warranting a formal correction.
