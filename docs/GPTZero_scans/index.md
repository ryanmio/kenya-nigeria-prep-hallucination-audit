### Interpreting GPTZero Scores

GPTZero's percentage is the model's **estimated probability** that a passage was written by AI (the remainder up to 100 % implies human authorship).  For example, a score of **6 % AI** means that in only 6 out of 100 comparable cases the text would be expected from AI, while 94 out of 100 would be human-written.  

*Scores near 0% or 100% are not definitive proof of origin; they are simply heuristics provided for transparency.*
